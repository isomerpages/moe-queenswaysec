### Mathematics Talent Development Programme

#### BRIEF SUMMARY OF EVENTS / ACHEIVEMENTS

The Mathematics Talent Development Programme in Queensway aims to provide a platform for students to develop their mathematical skills and thinking. Over the course of the programme, students are challenged to refine their critical thinking and communication skills as they engage with various mathematical concepts and ideas. 

Students are groomed to participate in the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad, where they showcase and apply the knowledge and skills that they have learned in the Maths TDP.

#### Student Experiences:

  
 _Phoebe Wong_<br>
“I have learned that there are multiple methods to solve a problem. We need to be methodical and careful in finding a solution.”  

  

_Imran Khan_<br>
“I have enjoyed learning different strategies of solving problems. This also helps in my study of Maths in the classroom. At first sight, a problem may seem challenging, but once we are able to understand the question, we can break to problem down into parts and solve it.”
