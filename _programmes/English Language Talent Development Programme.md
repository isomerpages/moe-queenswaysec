### English Language Talent Development Programme

#### BRIEF SUMMARY OF MAIN EVENTS / ACHIEVEMENTS

ELTDP had an eventful year despite the pandemic. The programme seeks to develop students’ interests and talents in English Language and Literature through exposure to texts beyond the taught curriculum as well as through opportunities to participate in various competitions and events. TD students read and created work across a wide variety of genres, from uniquely Singaporean twin cinema poems to learning about the psychology of telling a good joke. Students also wrote and delivered their own self-written speeches as part of a public speaking course in Term 3.

This year, TD students helmed the English Department’s annual Langlit Week, helping with publicity efforts to drive participation and interest in the event for the whole school. They also took part in the Queens’ Commonwealth Essay Competition, an international competition organised by the Royal Commonwealth Society in the UK. TDP students Lauren Lim (204), Samantha Widjaja (301) and Sabrina Widjaja (301) were also selected to attend the prestigious Creative Arts Programme (CAP) camp organised by the Gifted Education Branch.

#### Student Experiences:

_Lauren Lim_<br>
I really enjoyed being able to discuss language and literature with other people from Queensway whom I otherwise wouldn’t have met. It was a great choice for me to join and I can’t wait for next year!

EL TDP has been a really fun experience that has been extremely beneficial in developing my linguistic skills in a fun and exciting way. I especially appreciate interacting with the lovely community of teachers and students.
