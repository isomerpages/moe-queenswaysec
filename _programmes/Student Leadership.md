### Student Leadership

#### BRIEF SUMMARY OF EVENTS / ACHEIVEMENTS

Servant Leadership is the belief that the most effective leaders strive to serve others, rather than accrue power or take control. 

In 2022 our student leaders embodied this very belief as they picked up the baton from the graduating class of 2021. As the world slowly enters the new normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our student leaders have also started to step up to the challenge of leading from the front and serving their fellow students. Our prefects have been diligently carrying out their morning duties and have assisted in the smooth running of school events such as our annual Speech Day and at ad-hoc events such as the EU ambassador’s visit to QSS. Our Peer Support Leaders and Champions have been consistently developing a culture of care in the school by planning activities for students to be more aware of their own mental well-being as well as being empathetic to those around them. Serving alongside them are the CCA leaders who lead their teams with pride and assist the coaches and teachers. The House Leaders also serve to build house spirit and lead our students in cheers for our CCAs. The Class Committees steadfastly continued to take up additional responsibilities and assist class mentors in the smooth running of everyday school life.

As school-wide activities resumed in 2022, our student leaders have upheld the school values of Discipline, Respect, Responsibility and Excellence in the duties they perform. They lead by example and inspire their peers and juniors to do so as well. They truly follow our motto of “To Lead is To Serve”.


#### Student Experiences:

*Clarice Koh En Qi*,  _Trainee Prefect_<br>
“I feel extremely humbled to be able to serve the students as a trainee prefect. Now, I have the opportunity to lead the school in a manner which I could not before. Being a trainee prefect allows me to help in morning duties and participate in meetings, allowing me to not only get to know more people but also understand more about being a leader. I am glad to be given the opportunity to be a voice for my fellow peers and help them understand decisions made by the teachers.”

  

_Lee Shenlei, Volleyball Boys Captain_<br>
“I am grateful for the chance to step up and lead my CCA. Being a captain has contributed to my growth as a player and as a person, and while there have definitely been many difficulties throughout this journey, it has made me more disciplined, responsible, caring to those around me and has taught me to think critically when met with a tough situation.

One of my memorable moments during my leadership is this year's Queen’s Cup. I could tell that my teammates were all very nervous. To be honest, I was nervous myself, but I knew that I had to overcome it. If my teammates saw me in this state, they would become disheartened and discouraged. I calmed myself down, overcame my nervousness and confidently encouraged my team. It seems like a minor triumph but it definitely lightened the mood and I saw my team perk up and put their best foot forward in the match. This serves as a key memory and learning point that I will bring with me for the rest of my captaincy.

I do hope that I can continue to lead my CCA well and bring it to greater heights.”

  

_See Hui Lin, Peer Support Leader, Head of Publicity_<br>
“As the Head of Publicity for the PSLs, I had the opportunity to not only contribute my knowledge of mental wellness along with unique designs, but was able to lead my committee too.

The publicity committee is currently doing weekly posts on different topics per month for the school’s PSL Instagram. This required a lot of my committee’s time as well as coordination. It took a while for us to adjust as we were new to each other. However, over time, the bond between us grew stronger. Soon enough, we were not only able to coordinate our efforts and workflow reasonably well, we were able to have lots of fun learning and growing with each other.

Throughout my experience, I have learnt the importance of time management and teamwork. PSL will forever have a place in my heart and I will continue to serve the school to the best of my abilities.”

  

_Kang Qi Xuan, Head Prefect_<br>
"The Prefectorial Board has been a major stepping stone for me to improve my confidence and leadership skills as a student leader. I was able to improve my social skills by learning how to interact with strangers and making new friends, I was also able to learn how to plan events and make proposals which was something that I’ve never known prior to becoming a prefect.

I used to lead while thinking about the outcome and the results but now I think more about the process and the behind-the-scenes steps of getting to the outcome. This is crucial as the process is what helps us build those bonds that will generate amazing results as we learn how to work as a group with good chemistry. The little preparations before each event builds up the foundation of the event which is why I’ve come to appreciate the process of us working together even more than the result of the event. We’ve not only learnt how to plan events but we’ve also learnt how to lead our schoolmates and peers through different experiences such as ushering and learning how to balance our academics and leadership position at the same time.

Overall, this journey thus far has been a difficult but fulfilling journey. I’ve met so many new friends and people who I would willingly go up to and hold a conversation. I’ve also become closer to my teachers as they guide us and impart their knowledge of leadership to us. The amount of life skills like task organisation, being self-disciplined and practising good time management that I’ve picked up is something that I wholeheartedly thank the Prefectorial Board for. No words can describe my gratitude for how much the Prefectorial Board has shaped my core memory of Queensway Secondary School."

 ### Student Leadership Development

Our philosophy of student leadership development is guided by the following beliefs:

○      Every student has the potential to be    
        developed as a leader

○      Leadership entails confidence and taking the 
        initiatives to make a positive difference

○      Student leadership development needs to be 
        intentional

Our approach to student leadership curriculum development centres on the 7 Pillars of Servant Leadership with alignment to Thomas Lickona’s 8 Strengths of Character.

The Lower Secondary curriculum is based on the idea of “Unleashing the Servant Leader in You” and “Everyday Leadership”. The curriculum aims to convince students that each and every one of them has leadership potential that can be tapped every day and leadership is not solely the leading of big events. Students will learn the fundamental skills needed to be a leader and will be able to use them effectively to manage themselves and others. This involves having good self knowledge, sound values and personal effectiveness. Examples of lessons conducted for students include the exploration of servant leadership as well as learning facilitation skills.

The Upper Secondary curriculum enhances the lower secondary curriculum where ‘self’ and ‘team’ leadership are introduced. At Upper Secondary, student leaders are taught knowledge and skills to support initiatives for active student leadership to make a positive difference in class, at home, within the school and in the community. Hence, the key message to the student leaders is that leadership is not about positions of power but positions of positive influence. Past examples of opportunities available for the student leaders have included a mentorship program by university students and leadership workshops by external vendors.

The school has an extensive and structured system in providing opportunities for both broad-based and role-based student leadership development for our students.
