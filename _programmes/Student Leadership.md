### Student Leadership

#### BRIEF SUMMARY OF EVENTS / ACHEIVEMENTS

"To lead is to serve." This year, our student leaders showed their commitment to this motto as they took up various responsibilities to lead and help their peers, despite the many upheavals due to COVID-19. Our prefects, for instance, resumed their daily morning duty to ensure safety and discipline in the mornings as their peers arrived in school, while our Peer Support Leaders and Champions organised activities to promote awareness of mental wellbeing while continuing to look out for their peers' mental wellbeing. Alongside them, the CCA leaders and Class Committee steadfastly continued to take up additional duties such as managing the Personal Learning Devices for their classes, while encouraging their peers to adapt to Home-Based Learning and eCCAs. In a stressful year, they upheld the school values of responsibility, respect, discipline and excellence with good cheer, inspiring their peers and juniors to do so as well.  

  

  

#### Student Experiences:

_Cheyenne Ng, 304, Class Chairperson_<br>
“Being a class chairperson is not only about helping to maintain a learning environment in class or assisting the teachers. It is also about being there for your classmates and caring for their well-being. Through this experience, I have realised that leadership is a continuous process of growth, reflection and development, where I do my best to learn from my mistakes and move on to be better. It has been a fruitful experience for me to challenge myself and I have learnt a lot from carrying out my responsibilities.”

  

_Wayne Chan, 301, Class Chairperson_<br>
“I have enjoyed being a class chairperson for two years! I have learnt to be more responsible with my actions and more organised in terms of my work and time management. Being a class chairperson also gave me the opportunity to be a positive role model for others, as well as care for my peers and teachers!”

  

_Josef Lim, 311, Class Chairperson_<br>
“My experience as House Captain in Queensway Secondary School has been very enriching. I particularly enjoyed the various trainings and leadership programmes, which have helped me to develop my communication, collaboration and event planning skills.

The most memorable event for me this year was the 2021 Secondary One Orientation Camp, which I helped to organise and facilitate as Centaur House Captain. During the December holidays, we planned for activities, games and logistics with the orientation group leaders. It was a fun and meaningful process which brought us closer as a team.

Being a student leader has taught me to be more systematic and organised. It has also helped me to be a more confident person and hone my interpersonal skills. I hope to continue embodying our school core values of discipline, respect, responsibility and excellence in leading Centaur House.”

  

_Claris Loh Ern, 303, Griffin House Captain_<br>
“Being the house captain of Griffin has led me to have many memorable experiences that have enriched my Queensway journey and refined my leadership skills. My favourite part  about being a house captain is working together with other house leaders. This has allowed me to forge firm friendships and hone my teamwork skills. I hope to continue to make even more joyful memories in the future as House Captain of Griffin.”

  

_Goh Kai Xiang, 404, Community Service Club President_<br>
“My leadership journey in Queensway Secondary School has been joyous and eventful. I participated in many leadership courses, which taught me the importance of servant leadership and being passionate about helping others. I appreciate the many opportunities to facilitate and lead various CCA activities and projects, which have helped me grow as a confident team player.”

  

_Justin Lim, 401, Choir President and Deputy Head Prefect_<br>
“I am glad that I was given an opportunity to step up and lead the choir. My seniors have been very supportive and encouraging in my leadership journey. I first started out in an EXCO position, when my seniors motivated me to volunteer to be the Level head in choir.

While leadership has had its share of challenges, it has also been an enriching and fulfilling experience. During my term has as choir president, I learnt how to manage uncertain situations. Due to Covid-19, many events were in flux. With the support of my committee members and teachers in charge, we were able to modify and make the necessary arrangements for our choir sessions. I learnt the importance of forward planning and thinking on my feet to resolve problems that may arise suddenly. This has helped me to be a more adaptable person. I also learnt to be more patient and honed my interpersonal and communication skills.” 

  

_Inggrid Irrawaty, 401, Head Prefect_<br>
“The Prefectorial Board is an environment that allows me to strive for personal growth and achievement. It has ignited my passion for leadership. During my time with the Board, I realized that truly enjoying the process and time as a student leader was the key to passionate and genuine servant leadership. When I began to understand this, I was learning how to become a leader not because I had to, but because I sincerely wanted to be one.

The board meetings, Prefect camps, planning sessions and event executions all became my passion and I never found myself growing tired of the responsibilities. Rather, I wholeheartedly enjoyed all the time I spent with my dear friends in the Prefectorial Board, as well as the teachers who were patient, nurturing and diligent in guiding the prefects to develop their strengths and grow into confident leaders.

I will always hold my journey with the Prefectorial Board dear in my heart. It has truly been a meaningful experience for me, during which I forged strong bonds with my fellow prefects and honed my planning, organisation and interpersonal skills. I will always be thankful for the supportive community that has taught me that there are no boundaries to success and with determination and passion, nothing is unachievable.”

  

_Nurul Syazana Binte Misdi, 404, Head of Peer Support Board_<br>
“Our mission as Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) is to strive to lend a helping hand to others, by forming stepping stones between teachers and students. “A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor.” This quote resonates with us, because we believe that we should not back away from challenges, but face them head-on, as such experiences will make us tougher and more capable. With this in mind, we work to address key issues that our peers face, with the goal of ensuring their well-being and unity as a cohort.

This year, the PSLs have decided to focus on the importance of mental well-being as a key theme for our programmes. This is because we realised that mental health stigma is still a major issue in society. Many people are still unware of the importance of mental well-being and are quick to judge individuals with mental health illnesses. Hence, the PSLs felt the need to address these stigmas and ensure that we put an end to it. This resulted in 2021’s inaugural Mental Wellness Week, where we shared with our peers about the importance of mental health, as well as constructive ways to cope with stress. Our Peer Support Champions have also helped to ensure that their classmates have a caring shoulder to lean on in times of need.

We want Queenswayans to have a safe outlet to seek support because we believe that mental health is just as important as our physical health. If you are in need of assistance or a listening ear, we urge you to approach our friendly PSLs or PSCs, or dial up the helpline numbers that we have listed out for you.

Our teachers and school leaders have entrusted the Peer Support Board (PSB) with many opportunities to serve the school to the best of our abilities, from organising the Teachers’ Day Celebration in 2020, to inaugurating Mental Wellness Week in 2021. Spearheading these events has allowed us to hone our communication, collaboration and project management skills, shaping us into more confident leaders.

Last but not least, we would like to take the opportunity to show our gratitude to every member in Queensway Secondary School as we are surrounded by extremely supportive school leaders, teachers and peers. We promise to keep on growing and shining and to continue to never dull a moment in Queensway!”
