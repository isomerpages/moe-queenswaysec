### Student Leadership

#### BRIEF SUMMARY OF EVENTS / ACHEIVEMENTS

Servant Leadership is the belief that the most effective leaders strive to serve others, rather than accrue power or take control. 

In 2022 our student leaders embodied this very belief as they picked up the baton from the graduating class of 2021. As the world slowly enters the new normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our student leaders have also started to step up to the challenge of leading from the front and serving their fellow students. Our prefects have been diligently carrying out their morning duties and have assisted in the smooth running of school events such as our annual Speech Day and at ad-hoc events such as the EU ambassador’s visit to QSS. Our Peer Support Leaders and Champions have been consistently developing a culture of care in the school by planning activities for students to be more aware of their own mental well-being as well as being empathetic to those around them. Serving alongside them are the CCA leaders who lead their teams with pride and assist the coaches and teachers. The House Leaders also serve to build house spirit and lead our students in cheers for our CCAs. The Class Committees steadfastly continued to take up additional responsibilities and assist class mentors in the smooth running of everyday school life.

As school-wide activities resumed in 2022, our student leaders have upheld the school values of Discipline, Respect, Responsibility and Excellence in the duties they perform. They lead by example and inspire their peers and juniors to do so as well. They truly follow our motto of “To Lead is To Serve”.


#### Student Experiences:

*Clarice Koh En Qi*,  _Trainee Prefect_<br>
“I feel extremely humbled to be able to serve the students as a trainee prefect. Now, I have the opportunity to lead the school in a manner which I could not before. Being a trainee prefect allows me to help in morning duties and participate in meetings, allowing me to not only get to know more people but also understand more about being a leader. I am glad to be given the opportunity to be a voice for my fellow peers and help them understand decisions made by the teachers.”

  

_Lee Shenlei, Volleyball Boys Captain_<br>
“I am grateful for the chance to step up and lead my CCA. Being a captain has contributed to my growth as a player and as a person, and while there have definitely been many difficulties throughout this journey, it has made me more disciplined, responsible, caring to those around me and has taught me to think critically when met with a tough situation.

One of my memorable moments during my leadership is this year's Queen’s Cup. I could tell that my teammates were all very nervous. To be honest, I was nervous myself, but I knew that I had to overcome it. If my teammates saw me in this state, they would become disheartened and discouraged. I calmed myself down, overcame my nervousness and confidently encouraged my team. It seems like a minor triumph but it definitely lightened the mood and I saw my team perk up and put their best foot forward in the match. This serves as a key memory and learning point that I will bring with me for the rest of my captaincy.

I do hope that I can continue to lead my CCA well and bring it to greater heights.”

  

_See Hui Lin, Peer Support Leader, Head of Publicity_<br>
“As the Head of Publicity for the PSLs, I had the opportunity to not only contribute my knowledge of mental wellness along with unique designs, but was able to lead my committee too.

The publicity committee is currently doing weekly posts on different topics per month for the school’s PSL Instagram. This required a lot of my committee’s time as well as coordination. It took a while for us to adjust as we were new to each other. However, over time, the bond between us grew stronger. Soon enough, we were not only able to coordinate our efforts and workflow reasonably well, we were able to have lots of fun learning and growing with each other.

Throughout my experience, I have learnt the importance of time management and teamwork. PSL will forever have a place in my heart and I will continue to serve the school to the best of my abilities.”

  

_Claris Loh Ern, 303, Griffin House Captain_<br>
“Being the house captain of Griffin has led me to have many memorable experiences that have enriched my Queensway journey and refined my leadership skills. My favourite part  about being a house captain is working together with other house leaders. This has allowed me to forge firm friendships and hone my teamwork skills. I hope to continue to make even more joyful memories in the future as House Captain of Griffin.”

  

_Goh Kai Xiang, 404, Community Service Club President_<br>
“My leadership journey in Queensway Secondary School has been joyous and eventful. I participated in many leadership courses, which taught me the importance of servant leadership and being passionate about helping others. I appreciate the many opportunities to facilitate and lead various CCA activities and projects, which have helped me grow as a confident team player.”

  

_Justin Lim, 401, Choir President and Deputy Head Prefect_<br>
“I am glad that I was given an opportunity to step up and lead the choir. My seniors have been very supportive and encouraging in my leadership journey. I first started out in an EXCO position, when my seniors motivated me to volunteer to be the Level head in choir.

While leadership has had its share of challenges, it has also been an enriching and fulfilling experience. During my term has as choir president, I learnt how to manage uncertain situations. Due to Covid-19, many events were in flux. With the support of my committee members and teachers in charge, we were able to modify and make the necessary arrangements for our choir sessions. I learnt the importance of forward planning and thinking on my feet to resolve problems that may arise suddenly. This has helped me to be a more adaptable person. I also learnt to be more patient and honed my interpersonal and communication skills.” 

  

_Inggrid Irrawaty, 401, Head Prefect_<br>
“The Prefectorial Board is an environment that allows me to strive for personal growth and achievement. It has ignited my passion for leadership. During my time with the Board, I realized that truly enjoying the process and time as a student leader was the key to passionate and genuine servant leadership. When I began to understand this, I was learning how to become a leader not because I had to, but because I sincerely wanted to be one.

The board meetings, Prefect camps, planning sessions and event executions all became my passion and I never found myself growing tired of the responsibilities. Rather, I wholeheartedly enjoyed all the time I spent with my dear friends in the Prefectorial Board, as well as the teachers who were patient, nurturing and diligent in guiding the prefects to develop their strengths and grow into confident leaders.

I will always hold my journey with the Prefectorial Board dear in my heart. It has truly been a meaningful experience for me, during which I forged strong bonds with my fellow prefects and honed my planning, organisation and interpersonal skills. I will always be thankful for the supportive community that has taught me that there are no boundaries to success and with determination and passion, nothing is unachievable.”

  

_Nurul Syazana Binte Misdi, 404, Head of Peer Support Board_<br>
“Our mission as Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) is to strive to lend a helping hand to others, by forming stepping stones between teachers and students. “A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor.” This quote resonates with us, because we believe that we should not back away from challenges, but face them head-on, as such experiences will make us tougher and more capable. With this in mind, we work to address key issues that our peers face, with the goal of ensuring their well-being and unity as a cohort.

This year, the PSLs have decided to focus on the importance of mental well-being as a key theme for our programmes. This is because we realised that mental health stigma is still a major issue in society. Many people are still unware of the importance of mental well-being and are quick to judge individuals with mental health illnesses. Hence, the PSLs felt the need to address these stigmas and ensure that we put an end to it. This resulted in 2021’s inaugural Mental Wellness Week, where we shared with our peers about the importance of mental health, as well as constructive ways to cope with stress. Our Peer Support Champions have also helped to ensure that their classmates have a caring shoulder to lean on in times of need.

We want Queenswayans to have a safe outlet to seek support because we believe that mental health is just as important as our physical health. If you are in need of assistance or a listening ear, we urge you to approach our friendly PSLs or PSCs, or dial up the helpline numbers that we have listed out for you.

Our teachers and school leaders have entrusted the Peer Support Board (PSB) with many opportunities to serve the school to the best of our abilities, from organising the Teachers’ Day Celebration in 2020, to inaugurating Mental Wellness Week in 2021. Spearheading these events has allowed us to hone our communication, collaboration and project management skills, shaping us into more confident leaders.

Last but not least, we would like to take the opportunity to show our gratitude to every member in Queensway Secondary School as we are surrounded by extremely supportive school leaders, teachers and peers. We promise to keep on growing and shining and to continue to never dull a moment in Queensway!”
