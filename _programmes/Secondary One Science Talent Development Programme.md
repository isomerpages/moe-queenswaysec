### Secondary One Science Talent Development Programme

#### BRIEF SUMMARY OF EVENTS / ACHEIVEMENTS  

The Science Talent Development Programme aims to deepen students’ love of science. The programme provides opportunities for students to carry out hands-on experiments, helping them to acquire useful data collection skills. Students also learn to collaborate effectively, as they need to communicate information and ideas clearly in their teams.

  

Using the principle of density, students created a lava lamp. They also learned how to make plastics from milk and crystallise salts. Over the course of the Science TDP, students produced a pH indicator from purple cabbage and extracted deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from fruits. 

  

Other highlights of the Science TDP involve science ‘missions’, where students are challenged to put their problem-solving skills to the test and generate novel ideas, ranging from the creation of an egg lander, to creating a catapult made of ice cream sticks, as well as constructing a bridge from straws. 

#### Student Experiences:

 _Janine Teo_<br>
“All the experiences in Science TDP have been very memorable. My favourite experiences were the experiments on crystallization, the burning of magnesium and the use of purple cabbage as a pH indicator to test whether solutions were acidic or alkaline. I especially liked the crystallization experiment, because it allowed me to understand the process much more clearly than if I had just watched a video. I also learned that when magnesium is burned, it gives off a bright white light and forms magnesium oxide. Taking part in Science TDP has also taught me patience, as certain experiments need to be conducted over a longer period of time. Ultimately, I have learned that while success is not always certain, failing is also valuable, since we can learn and improve from our mistakes.”

“My favourite and most memorable experience in Science TDP so far is the ice cream catapult! I greatly enjoyed working with others and the process of trial and error in creating the best possible catapult. Science TDP has taught me never to give up and to always have a positive attitude towards Science.”
