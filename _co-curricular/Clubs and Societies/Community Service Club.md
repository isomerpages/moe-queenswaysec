#### Overview of the CCA:  

The Community Service Club is now three years old and continues to have the aim of nurturing caring citizens among Queenswayans. Our 26 enthusiastic members meet weekly to plan projects to meet the needs of the community, demonstrating a high level of commitment and passion to help others. 

Despite the pandemic, the Community Service Club continued to initiate creative fund-raising projects, which include selling of snacks, making handicrafts and setting up of carnival games. The funds raised from these projects far exceeded expectations.

In April, members also attended an awareness program conducted by the Singapore Association for the Deaf. Through the program they gained greater knowledge and understanding about the deaf community and also learnt some basic sign language. 

After the workshop, members designed materials to spread the awareness on caring for the deaf community in the school and the community. 

The Club also had the honour of collaborating with the Rainbow Centre in their inclusive play sessions. During these sessions, members interacted with differently-abled people, co-creating a cheer to promote inclusivity. A programme highlight were the virtual workout sessions where club members and their friends from the Rainbow Centre took part in fun exercises while simultaneously learning to care for each other.

The rich learning from participating in the variety of events was consolidated through reflection sessions facilitated by the teachers. Through reflection, members gained a greater understanding of their actions and constantly strive to better themselves.

  

#### Student Experiences:

“Being part of CSC is one of the most joyful experiences of my four years in QSS. This CCA has taught me many skills that will be useful for me in the future and has nurtured my passion to serve the community. I loved seeing the smiles on the faces of the elderly that we had helped out, and I also felt a strong sense of accomplishment knowing that I have brought joy to them. The many events that CSC organises yearly have also allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and expanded my view of the world.”
