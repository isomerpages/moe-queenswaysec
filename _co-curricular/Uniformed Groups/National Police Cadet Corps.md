In NPCC, we believe in developing all our cadets holistically. Our cadets will be given the opportunity to conduct training and activities under the supervision of our Teacher Officers to develop their leadership and communication skills. Cadets will be taught the basic drills and fundamental police knowledge.

*" These four years in Npcc has been a memorable and unique experience and has helped me to mature as a person. Throughout these few years i have learnt a lot of values such as leadership and teamwork which has helped me forge and strengthen my relationship with my peers. The achievements and awards I have received from npcc, has boosted my self confidence and has allowed me to keep on preserving and to not give up regardless of the ups and downs in these four years. In a nutshell, my time is npcc has been a fun and enjoyable one. It taught me that the greatest glory in living is not in never failing, but in rising and trying harder everytime we fall. Thank you Teacher Officers, Cadet Inspectors, my seniors and my peers for making my time in npcc an unforgettable one."

*"My experience in QSS NPCC will leave an indelible mark on me. It not only helped me mature as a student, but also allowed me to grasp many values such as discipline and leadership, those of which I have never mastered before. Even though my experience in the CCA wasn't an easy one, these obstacles I overcame in this journey taught me principles that I could apply both outside my student life and beyond. Without the support from my fellow squadmates, I would have never made it through till the end. It made me learn that "we need to have hardships for happiness to come in bigger amounts". This quote by Kang Taehyun undoubtedly supported me throughout my journey in NPCC. I hope that it will also push you to do your best too. Thank you to all my instructors and teacher officers for making my experience a memorable one!”
