#### Overview of the CCA:

Queensway Secondary School National Cadet Corps comprises more than 80 dedicated members.

Our core values are:

1\.   Loyalty to the country<br>
2\.   Uprightness<br>
3\.   Leadership<br>
4\.   Discipline<br>
5\.   Commitment and Responsibility<br>
6\.   Care for fellow cadets<br>
7\.   Adventurous spirit<br>
8\.   Safety.

  

Members are taught and display these core values during NCC’s trainings and camps. For instance, the core value of discipline must be adhered to during our weekly training sessions. The cadets develop resilience as they go through a series of physical conditioning exercises and strength training, such as pushups, planks, and sit-ups to prepare themselves for their yearly Physical Training test.

  

This year, our Secondary 1 cadets participated in Camp F.O.R.G.E, where they enjoyed fun and exciting activities such as the Flying Fox, Abseiling and High Elements. In Camp S.T.E.E.L, the Secondary 2 cadets were exposed to hands-on weapons training, where they learned how to dismantle and assemble the SAR-21, as well as how to deal with gun jams. Another highlight of Camp S.T.E.E.L was the paintball 5-versus-5 match, where the Secondary 2 cadets learned the value of teamwork, as they had to work together closely in order to achieve victory. Last but not least, the Secondary 3 cadets stepped up to teach their juniors key skills involved in the Total Defence Bronze and Silver courses, as part of their Total Defence Gold Course requirements.

  

#### Student Experiences: 

 “NCC has been an enriching CCA for me. I have got to know more people and forged firm friendshps with my CCA mates and juniors. Through participating in army drills, I have learned the value of responsibility and discipline.  Being familiar with the drill commands and footwork will also be beneficial for me when I serve NS in the future. Participating in the various NCC camps and courses have also developed my confidence and leadership skills, as I learned to work with different people.”

“NCC has been a truly wonderful experience for me. I have made so many new friends. Furthermore, participating in NCC has prepared me for National Service, especially with the hands-on training provided in Camps F.O.R.G.E and S.T.E.E.L. Overall, I do not regret choosing this CCA. It has been an amazing adventure!”

“Being in NCC has helped me develop my leadership skills that I would not be able to learn anywhere else. I have greatly enjoyed the fun experiences in Camp F.O.R.G.E and Camp S.T.E.E.L. Participating in these activities has taught me resilience and allowed me to build my confidence as a leader. The years I have spent in NCC have been fun and fruitful. I have made many new friends and fond memories in NCC.”
