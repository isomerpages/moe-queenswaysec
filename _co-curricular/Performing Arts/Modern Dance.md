#### Overview of the CCA:

Queensway Secondary School Modern Dance is the school’s newest CCA founded in 2021, comprising 27 members from Secondary 1-3. Under the guidance of our talented instructor Mr Robin, dance members have developed a strong foundation in dance skills, grown in their understanding of dance, and deepened their commitment to the group.

Being a new CCA, the group has taken the first half of the year to focus on developing a strong culture of teamwork, building up students’ physical strength and strengthening their foundation in dance skills. Nonetheless, the group has seized other opportunities to participate in performances together, and put together a dance item to Bruno Mars’ “Treasure” for this year’s QSS Got Talent competition. Through this experience, they learnt the importance of discipline, teamwork and unity in the pursuit of achieving excellence in their dance skills, with many of the stronger members helping to train those that struggled to learn the dance moves.

For many of the members, this CCA is their first time learning modern dance, and they have put in commendable effort to commit to the rigorous training required of dancers. A number of them transited from other forms of dance, such as Malay Dance, Chinese Dance or ballet, and had to learn how to adapt their movements and habits to a new form of dance. 

#### Student Experiences:

“I enjoy every bit of my CCA sessions because when we are dancing, we are exercising and that helps us feel good. Dance is a way for me to relax and express myself without even speaking. While it was a little difficult to change from Malay Dance to Modern Dance, I’m getting used to it now, and I enjoy them both because they’re both dance forms. Modern dance has benefitted me by strengthening my body, endurance and motor fitness. I hope that by the end of my secondary school life, I will have become a better dancer.”

“I enjoy this CCA a lot; maybe because there are fewer people in our CCA, I feel that it’s easier to connect with people in the CCA and we have become quite a close knit group. Also, thanks to this CCA, I learnt many more techniques and I’ve also learnt to be more patient and understanding. Along the way, I’ve definitely learnt to be more diligent and focused as I realised that one person could make a very big difference to the overall performance of the whole team. I hope that our CCA can participate in well-known dance competitions in future!”

“I enjoy this CCA a lot, even though it can be very tiring at times. Dancing is my passion, and I can have fun in this CCA. Through physical training, I’ve gotten stronger and more flexible. It has also helped me become more responsible as I cared for my juniors who needed help with their dance moves. I hope to see the CCA achieve distinction in competitions and performances in future.”
