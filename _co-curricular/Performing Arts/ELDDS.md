#### Overview of the CCA:

After spending several months attending CCA online last year, many club members were excited to attend CCA physically again. The CCA sessions began with the preparation for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Presentation. Due to the uncertain pandemic situation, adjustments had to be constantly made to take into account the safe management measures. Nonetheless, the actors took all the changes in their stride to achieve a Certificate of Accomplishment. 

Besides preparing for SYF Presentation, club members also had to prepare for the Chinese New Year Concert, National Day Concert and Teachers’ Day Concert. They had to write the scripts, rehearse the scenes, record and edit the videos while juggling their studies. Even though the members were not able to perform in front of a live audience, there was no lacking of opportunities for members to try out a new platform for performance.

Since the members were unable to go out and watch plays, the teachers brought the play “October’ to the members. Through watching the play, members had a better understanding of the issues faced by elderly. The lower secondary members also took part in the Artist in Residence project – a scriptwriting course – and interviewed some of the school alumni for the 60th anniversary video.

Hopefully, as the restrictions ease next year, the members can go on more learning journeys and interact more with the community.

#### Student Experiences:

“Drama was one of my greatest experiences in my secondary school life. I made many friends, across the different levels, who all have taught me different lessons to help me improve my confidence and skills. The very first session scared me as everyone seemed so skilled and talented but throughout the years, I learned to grow my confidence in an accepting environment. I am grateful for the experience I had with the club and hope that the club will continue to grow.”
