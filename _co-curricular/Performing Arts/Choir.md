Choir put up performances for Inaugural Assembly, Chinese New Year, Speech Day, Aesthetics Night, National Day. We also went on a Learning Journey to watch a concert at The Art House. We performed at CHIJMES during the September holidays and will also be taking part in a choir exchange programme in November where our choir will be performing with a number of other choirs on the same stage.

"In Sec 1, I was very new to choir but I found my seniors in Sec 2 and Sec 3 very kind and helpful. Although it is not always easy to control the choir as the President, but we do get things done quite efficiently and that is what I enjoy most about being in the choir.  Singing is the performance of a choir but teamwork MAKES the choir."

"My time in choir has been a meaningful experience and I have learnt a lot about myself that I would not have otherwise learnt. Choir is like life. It has its high and low notes."
