#### Overview of CCA:

During the year, QSS choristers created several song items for our school celebrations which included, ‘Welcome to the Family’ to welcome the secondary 1 students into the Queensway Family. Other song items included a medley of Chinese New Year songs and National Day songs to promote joy in the celebrations. Their effort and determination has spurred one another to be adaptable while continuing to strive for excellence amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. 

  

QSS choristers also adapted well to the hybrid sessions and took pride in the entire process. Despite all the constraints, they injected their creativity in the Japanese song piece, ‘Chorus of Love’ composed by Rejiro Koroku and arranged by Takatomi Nobunaga for the Singapore Youth Festival. The song aimed to spread the message of love and unity, a message dearly needed in this time of the pandemic.


#### Student Experiences:

“Throughout my time in the QSS Choir, I encountered many memorable and interesting experiences. Being in the choir taught me how to cooperate with one another in order to ensure that the different sounds of the choir blend well. Being in the school choir also taught me how to adapt to changing situations. Lastly, it also gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge of choral music and understand how choral music works on a deeper level.”

“Being part of the school choir was one of the best things that ever happened to me in my secondary school life. It was the place where I felt a sense of belonging with memories that could last a lifetime. It also imbued me with a sense of responsibility and confidence I wouldn't have gotten anywhere else. To me, the choir is not only about singing; it is also about teamwork and perseverance. All in all, QSS Choir holds a special place in my heart and I've had the most blissful journey these 3 and half years.”
<br> **Dania Sharjeel (403) Vice-President**

  

“Over the course of my QSS Choir journey, my horizons have certainly been broadened as I have had the opportunity to learn various new singing techniques to enhance the quality of my singing as well as the theoretical aspects of the music in the songs we sing. Additionally, through being part of the QSS Choir, I have been exposed to a variety of foreign languages and diverse cultures from around the globe, including the Brazilian dance song Muié Rendêra and the Korean pop song Eyes Nose Lips. Even when COVID-19 struck in 2020 and numerous CCA-related activities such as live performances were unable to take place, there was never a dull moment during my time in the QSS Choir. The members always put in their 100 percent during CCA time while learning and practicing together. The choir teachers have been ever-patient and caring towards us alongside our phenomenal conductors who have taught us so much. In retrospect, I strongly believe that being in the QSS Choir has been an enjoyable, educational and meaningful experience for me, and I have absolutely no regrets joining the QSS Choir.”
