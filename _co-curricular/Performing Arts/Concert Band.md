**Overview of the CCA:** 

Queensway Secondary School Concert Band aims to cultivate in students a passion for music-making and a sense of responsibility, while encompassing the 21st Century Competencies in education.

Throughout the year with the evolving COVID-19 situation and safe management measures, band members displayed a high level of resilience by adapting to different modes of training, from small group practices to virtual practices. Members took advantage of these platforms to gain new musical experiences and hone different aspects of musicianship.

In constant pursuit of musical excellence, the band always takes part in both national and international showcases and competitions. This year, the band participated in the Singapore Youth Festival: Arts Presentation, and was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment. It is our desire that the passion of music-making continues to grow in all the members despite challenges brought on by the pandemic.

#### Achievements of the CCA:

**Singapore Youth Festival 2021:** Arts Presentation - Certificate of Accomplishment

  

#### Student Experiences:

“Being in band for four years was a tough yet fruitful journey; especially since the last two years in the midst of Covid-19. Yet, that did not stop us from pushing on by participating in SYF 2021. It was challenging for sure as we had to split the band into two groups and unfortunately, not all of us had a chance to be on the stage. Nonetheless, the experiences I had gone through in band instilled many values in me and I am grateful for it. Specifically one important value that has moulded me is discipline, as being discipline would only lead you to greater heights.”

“My favourite memory was participating in the SYF Arts Presentation with my friends and band members. Through preparing for it, the band created a strong sense of belonging. Though the Covid-19 situation stopped us from having face-to-face practices in the band room, and practices were moved online, we learnt how to grow and adapt to tough situations as one.” 
<br> **Jorine Tan Ying Xi (311)**

“One of my favourite memories in band was participating in the Singapore Youth Festival with my seniors. I remember how hard we prepared and practiced for it. Though I was hoping we could achieve the Certificate of Distinction, I still enjoyed the practices with my fellow bandmates, as it is about the journey, not the destination. Through band, I learnt many things which helped me improve my musical skills. I enjoyed coming together and making music with my fellow bandmates which made my time in band a very enjoyable one.”
