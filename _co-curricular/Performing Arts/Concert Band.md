Queensway Secondary School Concert Band aims to cultivate students to develop a passion for music-making and to instill them a sense of responsibility, living up to 21st Century Competencies and values of team-work and leadership.

To keep the band members actively involved in honing their skills and bringing their musicality to greater heights, the band always takes part in both national and international competitions, as well as exchanges with other school bands. The highlight yearly for QSS band is the year-end band concert which serves as a platform for the band members to exercise their leadership qualities and showcase their talents. This year, QSS Band also participated in the Aesthetics Night.



#### Achievements of the CCA:
CERTIFICATE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT IN SYF (2021)

  

#### Student Experiences:

“Being in band for four years was a tough yet fruitful journey; especially since the last two years in the midst of Covid-19. Yet, that did not stop us from pushing on by participating in SYF 2021. It was challenging for sure as we had to split the band into two groups and unfortunately, not all of us had a chance to be on the stage. Nonetheless, the experiences I had gone through in band instilled many values in me and I am grateful for it. Specifically one important value that has moulded me is discipline, as being discipline would only lead you to greater heights.”

“My favourite memory was participating in the SYF Arts Presentation with my friends and band members. Through preparing for it, the band created a strong sense of belonging. Though the Covid-19 situation stopped us from having face-to-face practices in the band room, and practices were moved online, we learnt how to grow and adapt to tough situations as one.” 
<br> **Jorine Tan Ying Xi (311)**

“One of my favourite memories in band was participating in the Singapore Youth Festival with my seniors. I remember how hard we prepared and practiced for it. Though I was hoping we could achieve the Certificate of Distinction, I still enjoyed the practices with my fellow bandmates, as it is about the journey, not the destination. Through band, I learnt many things which helped me improve my musical skills. I enjoyed coming together and making music with my fellow bandmates which made my time in band a very enjoyable one.”
