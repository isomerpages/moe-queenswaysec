This year, unfortunately due to Covid-19, the national tournament (as with all sports CCAs) was cancelled.

  

Although there were no physical sessions during the circuit breaker period, members were engaged through e-CCA sessions, which happened weekly for an hour.

  

While there were challenges that both teachers and students had to overcome,, it was stressed that it was more important to engage with one another socially to take advantage of the opportunity to interact and bond.

  

As we moved into Phase 2 of Circuit Breaker, the new norm progressively allowed for physical training sessions to resume. At the start, we could only engage members from individual classes at any one time, once a week. This soon progressed to the current situation where training sessions could be done for each leve, up to a maximum of 20 students at each session.

  

We hope that the boys will continue to train hard and do well in next year’s competition as we look forward to Phase 3 of Circuit Breaker, where training sessions can resume close to as normal as it can be possible. Even so, we would do well not to let our guard down and to train in a socially responsible manner.
