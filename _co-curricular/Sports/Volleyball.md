#### Overview of the CCA:   

“Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.” As we know, teamwork is essential in volleyball. Not only does it play an important role in the success of the team, but it also accentuates just how well the team works together. Being in volleyball trains one’s reflexes as well as the ability to think on the spot. Volleyball is a game of resilience, intelligence as well as sportsmanship.

With Covid-19 regulations intercepting our path to competitions, the usual rules were replaced by a 3-versus-3 structure. Foreign to the new structure of the upcoming games, many hours were spent in adapting to the changes. Through blood, sweat, tears and many arduous hours of intensive training, the volleyball girls emerged second in the South zone game whereas the volleyball boys emerged third. Our volleyball boys and girls will continue to strive forward through thick and thin. Together.

#### Student Experiences:

“I joined the volleyball CCA due to my fascination with the sport. However, I have come to realize that the fun does not lie in playing the sport, but in playing it with your friends. Thanks to the CCA, I made such great and supportive friends. Additionally, it has helped me grow into a leader and a much more confident and quick thinking person. After stepping down from the position, I realized how big volleyball had played a part in my life. I will always miss the fun times with my juniors and playing on the court with my team. If I had the chance, I would love to stay with them longer. To me, volleyball is not just a CCA but a family that I love very much.”

“Throughout my volleyball journey, I have had many memorable moments. At the start, I did not have any expectations for this CCA, however, over time, it became a part of me. The friends I made in this CCA offer me uplifting companionship when I feel lonely. The bond that my teammates and I have formed seems like a pulling force that draws us closer and is worth cherishing for life. Thanks to volleyball, I have learnt to work as a team as well as motivate my teammates. Besides leadership qualities, I learnt that volleyball builds tenacity and teamwork. Volleyball has given me an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. Not only was there a lot of laughter during training, there was also long lasting friendship that was formed over the last four years.  After I have graduated from Queensway Secondary School, I am sure that I will still stay in touch with these friends that I have made.”

“Volleyball has helped me to grow and improve my character. Throughout my three and a half years in volleyball, I have learnt many values such as discipline, teamwork and leadership. I have been tasked with many responsibilities which has allowed me to learn these values. My experience in the CCA is one that I will definitely cherish for the rest of my life, and I hope that Queensway Volleyball will continue to achieve excellence.”
<br> **Aiden Justin Tan (403) ‘B’ Boys’ Captain**

  

“Volleyball has boosted my confidence and brought me to the next stage in life. I have never thought that volleyball could change my character. I was given leadership opportunities to experience these values. My experience in Queensway Volleyball is something that cannot be bought and I will cherish it forever. I hope our school’s volleyball continues to achieve success in its future endeavors.”
