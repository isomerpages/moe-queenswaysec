#### Overview of CCA:

In basketball CCA, we believe in working hard and training together as a team rather than the individual in training. A cooperative team spirit must be cultivated both on and off the court. Beyond the team, we believe in developing resilience, an essential 21st Century Competency. At the end of their QSS journey, we want to develop future-ready citizens who can contribute to society.

  

Unfortunately, for the past two years, competitions have also been suspended. Hence, we organised our own intra-CCA 3X3 basketball competition to allow our players to experience a competitive game. The event was well-received by our students.

  

With the changes in safe management measures, we moved to eCCA for different levels of students from time to time. We are thankful that we have a very resourceful coach who can conduct engaging eCCA. 

  

Our boys believe that if they put in the hard work, the results will come. They must always think that winning also goes back to work ethic and training as hard as possible for every practice. Players make each other better by competing hard in practice. We hope that all the basketball players would continue to train hard, play smart and bring about more success in the inter-school competitions in the future.

  

#### Student Experiences:

"We look forward to an opportunity to represent the school next year. The fruits of our labour will be seen in the tournament."
