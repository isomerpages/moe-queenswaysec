#### Overview of the CCA:

Badminton is a popular racquet sport worldwide which requires fast, powerful shots and agile footwork. So after a long hiatus of 19 years, badminton was finally reintroduced as a CCA this year - albeit to the girls only due to constrains of training venues. 

  

Following a series of CCA trials, 12 promising girls were selected for the inaugural team. The girls displayed their discipline and enthusiasm through their punctuality and eagerness to acquire new skills and knowledge. The girls had shown vast improvements from when they first joined, to now, displaying potentials in their individual talents.

  

When the Covid-19 Phase 2 Heightened Alert was raised this year, face-to-face sessions were suspended, and training took on an online format. Despite the restrictions, the girls showed resilience and independence. The coach and the team here had been resourceful to adapt to the changing situations. 

  

We hope that the foundation of resilience, discipline and team work amongst the girls continues to be the bedrock of their progress!

  

#### Student Experiences:

“Training was tiring but it’s worth it as it kept us fit and healthy and we got to hang out with our CCA mates most of the time.”

“Though the training was sometimes extremely tiring, I always looked forward to playing badminton or learning new badminton skills with my friends. It was a "break" for me.”
<br> **Angeline Ng 104**

“It was fun knowing everyone. Although CCA was at times tiring, I learned a lot of new skills.”
