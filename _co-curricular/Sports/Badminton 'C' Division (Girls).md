The newly formed team, comprised of beginners in majority, go through the development training programme where they learn fundamental technical skills in the beginning and gradually progress to in-depth in acquiring these skills.

The players also participate in the annual national school games competitions where they will exhibit sportmanships, perseverance and resilience in them during the games.

Platforms are given to unleash the players’ potential to lead especially in areas such as warm-up sessions during trainings, debriefing session after trainings and involvement in the Sec 1 trial.

Most importantly, the CCA continue to instill in the players the ‘joy of learning’ and ‘learning for life’ spirit in their 4 to 5 years in this CCA.

  
*"The best memory was winning our first match as a team in the C division competition. It was an accomplishment as we are a new team without experience. 
Besides, the debriefing session after matches allows the team to reflect on their gameplay and learn from the mistakes made. 
With a positive mindset, I believe that the team will continue to improve and succeed in future."
~Tan Yu Qi (203)*

*"A meaningful experience in my CCA which I led the whole team in the warm-up session during training and also involved in the Sec 1 trial selection. 
I learn to lead and take responsibility in carrying out tasks. We will keep improving to do the school proud eventually."
~ Tan Ying Yi Matilda (203)*
