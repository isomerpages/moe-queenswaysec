#### Overview of the CCA:  

The club is growing steadily and we have a healthy and steady strength of 20 students in the club who are passionate to serve the community and others. During the period before SMMs were relaxed, we conducted sessions where we practiced and familiarized ourselves with various activities that we would organize for the beneficiaries when we are able to meet them face-to face. We practiced playing the sound shapes, organizing dominoes activities, etc. In addition, we organized a couple of online sessions with a few organizations. After SMMs were relaxed, we were ready to go and organized face-to-face sessions with my partners such as Lion Befrienders for block parties, Play inclusive with Rainbow (Margaret Drive). The club is looking forward to more such sessions in 2023.

#### Student Experiences:

“Being part of CSC is one of the most joyful experiences of my four years in QSS. This CCA has taught me many skills that will be useful for me in the future and has nurtured my passion to serve the community. I loved seeing the smiles on the faces of the elderly that we had helped out, and I also felt a strong sense of accomplishment knowing that I have brought joy to them. The many events that CSC organises yearly have also allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and expanded my view of the world.”
