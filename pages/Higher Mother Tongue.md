### Higher Mother Tongue

Students who wish to take Higher Mother Tongue must meet either of the criteria below:\- obtained a PSLE Score of 8 or better AND took MTL at PSLE;

\- obtained with a PSLE Score of 9-14 AND obtained AL1/AL2 in MTL or D/M in HMTL

Students who do not meet the criteria above, but display high level of interest and ability in Chinese Language and wish to take Higher Chinese Language (HCL) would have to sit for a diagnostic assessment prior to being offered the subject.

All eligible students will receive the offer through Parents’ Gateway (PG). We will require parents of these students to **respond to the PG message**. These students do not have to purchase their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) books until the offer to take HCL is confirmed by the school.

Our school offers Higher Chinese Language (HCL), while Higher Malay and Higher Tamil Language will be offered in another secondary school. **For further queries, please email HOD/Mother Tongue Languages, Mr Teo Kian Wee, at** [**teo\_kian\_wee@moe.edu.sg**](mailto:teo_kian_wee@moe.edu.sg)**.**
