Please take note of these points below:

**1.**    **Subject Based Banding, SBB (Only Applicable to NA & NT students)**

For students who qualify for Subject Based Banding, you will receive a letter of offer from the school via PG. If you are not on board PG, you may also check the notice board at the school security counter for Subject Based Banding eligibility. It is important that you check if your child is eligible for SBB, as this will determine the books you should purchase.
