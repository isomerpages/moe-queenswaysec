#### Other languages other than Mainstream Mother Tongue (languages other than Chinese, Malay or Tamil)

As part of MOE’s bilingual policy, it is compulsory for all students to take at least one language as their Mother Tongue Language. Other than the mainstream Mother Tongue Languages, some students are eligible to take other languages as their Mother Tongue Language, while some are eligible to take a 3rd language.

The list of students who are eligible for such Mother Tongue Languages and 3rd languages are attached below.

As these lessons are conducted in other centres, such students are to follow the instructions as listed below.
