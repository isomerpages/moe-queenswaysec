### School Health & Dental Visits (Important)

Dear parents, the Health Promotion Board (HPB)’s School Health and Dental Services will be conducting its annual health screening, immunisation and dental services for your child.  
  
Please refer to the letter and access the [**Child Consent Portal**](https://childconsent.hpb.gov.sg/ship/process/SHIP/OnlineChildConsentPortal) to provide consent and update your child's medical information.  
  
Thank you.
