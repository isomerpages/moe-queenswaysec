<h4>Overview of the CCA:</h4>
<p>Dance Club uniquely combines contemporary and Chinese dance traditions
with artistic excellence. Our dancers demonstrate exceptional skill and
dedication through their performances at major school events and achievements
in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation - Modern Dance (2025,
2023) and Chinese Dance (2024). Beyond technical mastery, we nurture values
of resilience, teamwork and artistic appreciation. Through rigorous training
and passionate performances, our Dance Club continues to inspire and push
boundaries, developing not just skilled dancers, but well-rounded individuals
who excel in both art and character.</p>

<h4>Student Experiences:</h4>
<p><em>"As we are a relatively new CCA, Aesthenics Night was only our second time performing live. It was also my first dance performance in front of my family members and friends. We practiced for months and put in a lot of effort to make the show memorable and enjoyable, and I'm glad it was not in vain. Hearing the cheers and claps from our supporters made it a really unforgettable memory."<br>~Judith Kwa</em>
</p>
<p><em>"The CCA Fair performance at the start of the year was our first live performance. Although only the Sec Ones saw it, I still felt very accomplished as the performance went well and we gained many new members despite being a new CCA. The preparation was tiring and we were so busy that week but we all did our part to make it work."<br>~Nyguen</em>
