<p>Although relatively new as a CCA, our Dance club has made their mark on
Queensway through their exciting performances. Our dancers have a passion
for the art form and are given numerous opportunities to showcase their
skills in front of audiences at events such as Speech Day and the school
Aesthetics Night.</p>

<h4>Student Experiences:</h4>
<p><em>"As we are a relatively new CCA, Aesthenics Night was only our second time performing live. It was also my first dance performance in front of my family members and friends. We practiced for months and put in a lot of effort to make the show memorable and enjoyable, and I'm glad it was not in vain. Hearing the cheers and claps from our supporters made it a really unforgettable memory."<br>~Judith Kwa</em>
</p>
<p><em>"The CCA Fair performance at the start of the year was our first live performance. Although only the Sec Ones saw it, I still felt very accomplished as the performance went well and we gained many new members despite being a new CCA. The preparation was tiring and we were so busy that week but we all did our part to make it work."<br>~Nyguen</em>
