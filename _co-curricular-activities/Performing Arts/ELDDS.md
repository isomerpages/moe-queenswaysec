#### Overview of the CCA:

This year, besides having two new instructors to coach the students, the club also had many opportunities to try out new things. In addition to acting skills, students also learnt how to dance as part of their exposure to musical.

With the easing of SMM, students also had a chance to perform in front of a live audience for the Aesthetics Night. Regenia and Jaedon co-wrote the script for the school’s Aesthetics Night performance which was well-received by the audience.

The student-led Values-in-Action this year was conducted in collaboration with Queenstown Library. After weeks of rehearsal, the Secondary 3 students put up a short performance at the library for the children.

After 2 long years, the club finally had a chance to go on a learning journey to the Esplanade and attended a show Assembly by Drama Box. Needless to say, the students thoroughly enjoyed themselves!

Overall, it was a year filled with new and exciting challenges and as the students prepare for next year’s SYF, they continue to develop themselves holistically.

  

#### Achievements of the CCA:

**Singapore Youth Festival 2021:** Arts Presentation - Certificate of Accomplishment

  

#### Student Experiences:

“Drama was one of my greatest experiences in my secondary school life. I made many friends, across the different levels, who all have taught me different lessons to help me improve my confidence and skills. The very first session scared me as everyone seemed so skilled and talented but throughout the years, I learned to grow my confidence in an accepting environment. I am grateful for the experience I had with the club and hope that the club will continue to grow.”
