Our students also have the opportunity to serve the community. In 2022, after weeks of rehearsal, the Secondary 3 students put up a short performance at the library for children at Queenstown Library.

The Club also provides exposure to our budding actors, scriptwriters, directors and producers by organising learning journeys and theatre trips.
