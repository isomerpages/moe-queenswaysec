<h4>Overview of the CCA:</h4>
<p>QSS's Drama Club gives our students the chance to develop their creativity
and confidence through a variety of activities.
<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to taking part in the Singapore Youth Festival, the Drama
Club regularly holds performances at events such as Speech Day and the
school's Aesthetics Night.

<p>Our students also have the opportunity to serve the community. In 2022,
after weeks of rehearsal, the Secondary 3 students put up a short performance
at the library for children at Queenstown Library.</p>
<p>The Club also provides exposure to our budding actors, scriptwriters,
directors and producers by organising learning journeys and theatre trips.</p>

<h4>Student Experiences:</h4>
<p><em>"My role as the President of Drama Club is a great honour to me. Being able to lead such amazing and passionate actors, and making so many precious memories with my members still seems unbelievable to me, and I would trade the world for a chance to experience it again..‚Äù <br>~Ang En (403)</em>
