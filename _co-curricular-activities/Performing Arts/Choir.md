#### Overview of the CCA:&nbsp;  

Queensway's Choir seeks to inculcate not just a passion for music in our students but also develop their character through our activities.

This year, the Choir put up a number of performances at the Inaugural Assembly, Chinese New Year concert, Speech Day concert, Aesthetics Night and National Day concert. We also went on a learning journey to watch a concert at The Art House. We performed at CHIJMES during the September holidays and will also be taking part in a choir exchange programme in November where our choir will be performing with several other choirs on the same stage.

#### Student Experiences:

*"In Sec 1, I was very new to choir but I found my seniors in Sec 2 and Sec 3 very kind and helpful. Although it is not always easy to control the choir as the President, but we do get things done quite efficiently and that is what I enjoy most about being in the choir.&nbsp; Singing is the performance of a choir but teamwork MAKES the choir."
<br>~Seth*

*"My time in choir has been a meaningful experience and I have learnt a lot about myself that I would not have otherwise learnt. Choir is like life. It has its high and low notes."
<br>~Raakin*
