<h4>Overview of the CCA:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Queensway's Choir seeks to inculcate not just a passion for music in our
students but also develop their character through our activities.</p>

Inaugural Assembly, Chinese New Year concert, Speech Day concert, Aesthetics
Night and National Day concert. There are also opportunities for learning
journeys and external performances, including at the Arts House.</p>

<h4>Student Experiences:</h4>
<p><em>"In Sec 1, I was very new to choir but I found my seniors in Sec 2 and Sec 3 very kind and helpful. Although it is not always easy to control the choir as the President, but we do get things done quite efficiently and that is what I enjoy most about being in the choir.&nbsp; Singing is the performance of a choir but teamwork MAKES the choir." <br>~Seth</em>
</p>
<p><em>"My time in choir has been a meaningful experience and I have learnt a lot about myself that I would not have otherwise learnt. Choir is like life. It has its high and low notes." <br>~Raakin</em>
