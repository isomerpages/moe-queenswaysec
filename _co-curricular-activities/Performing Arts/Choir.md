<h4>Overview of the CCA:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Queensway's Choir seeks to inculcate not just a passion for music in our
students but also develop their character through our activities.</p>
<p>This year, the Choir put up a number of performances at the Inaugural
Assembly, Chinese New Year concert, Speech Day concert, Aesthetics Night
and National Day concert. We also went on a learning journey to watch a
concert at The Art House. We performed at CHIJMES during the September
holidays and will also be taking part in a choir exchange programme in
November where our choir will be performing with several other choirs on
the same stage.</p>

<h4>Achievement in 2023:</h4>
<p>CERTIFICATE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT IN SYF</p>
<h4>Student Experiences:</h4>
<p><em>"In Sec 1, I was very new to choir but I found my seniors in Sec 2 and Sec 3 very kind and helpful. Although it is not always easy to control the choir as the President, but we do get things done quite efficiently and that is what I enjoy most about being in the choir.&nbsp; Singing is the performance of a choir but teamwork MAKES the choir." <br>~Seth</em>
</p>
<p><em>"My time in choir has been a meaningful experience and I have learnt a lot about myself that I would not have otherwise learnt. Choir is like life. It has its high and low notes." <br>~Raakin</em>
