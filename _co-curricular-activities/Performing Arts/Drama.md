<h4>Overview of the CCA:</h4>
<p>The Drama Club had a vibrant year filled with creativity and teamwork.
A key highlight was our participation in the 2025 Singapore Youth Festival,
where we were awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment! We performed an
original script, <em>iLIFE – The App-solutely Absurd Adventures of Automation</em>,
with pride and gusto. Through every rehearsal and performance, we grew
as performers and storytellers, united by our passion for the stage. We
look forward to more unforgettable moments as we grow from strength to
strength!</p>
