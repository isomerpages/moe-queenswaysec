#### Overview of the CCA:Â

Although relatively new as a CCA, our Modern Dance club has made their mark on Queensway through their exciting performances. Our dancers have a passion for the art form and are given numerous opportunities to showcase their skills in front of audiences at events such as Speech Day and the school Aesthetics Night. In 2023, Modern Dance is looking forward to making their debut at the Singapore Youth Festival!

#### Student Experiences:

*"As we are a relatively new CCA, Aesthenics Night was only our second time performing live. It was also my first dance performance in front of my family members and friends. We practiced for months and put in a lot of effort to make the show memorable and enjoyable, and I'm glad it was not in vain. Hearing the cheers and claps from our supporters made it a really unforgettable memory."

*"The CCA Fair performance at the start of the year was our first live performance. Although only the Sec Ones saw it, I still felt very accomplished as the performance went well and we gained many new members despite being a new CCA. The preparation was tiring and we were so busy that week but we all did our part to make it work."
