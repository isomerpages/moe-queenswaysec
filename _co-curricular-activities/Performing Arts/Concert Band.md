<h4>Overview of the CCA:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>To keep the band members actively involved in honing their skills and
bringing their musicality to greater heights, QSS Band took part in the
Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and attained the Certificate
of Accomplishment. Another highlight of the year was the band’s participation
in the Band Exchange organised by Queenstown Secondary School, which served
as a platform for the band members to interact with the band students from
other schools and learn from each other. The band also participated in
the school-based events such as Queens Anniversary and National Day Celebration.</p>

<h4>Student Experiences:</h4>
<p><em>"During my time in the Concert Band, I have shared enjoyable and meaningful experiences with my fellow band members, be it juniors or seniors. One of my favourite memories in the band was during Aesthetics Night, where 5 different aesthetics CCAs came together to put on a show for everyone."<br>~Ethan Chan</em>
</p>
<p><em>"All band sessions are meaningful. After a long day of school, band helps us to de-stress as we leave our worries outside the band room for that few hours. There will always be something to take home from every practice, be it knowledge, skills or even life lessons.” <br>~Chloe Cheong</em>
