#### Overview of the CCA:

The motto of Queensway’s Chinese Dance is “To watch us dance, is to hear our hearts speak”. It reminds us to stay passionate and committed to dancing. In 2022, with the relaxation of Safe Management Measures, we have taken part in internal events like Chinese New Year, Speech Day and National Day concerts as well as Fiesta Mondial, our school’s Aesthetics Night. Our rigorous training sessions help our dancers strengthen their techniques and maintain their flexibility. Long-lasting friendships and values such as teamwork, perseverance and discipline are also emphasised. <br>

#### Student Experiences:

*“Honestly, being a part of Queensway Chinese Dance has been so fulfilling and rewarding. From the different types of traditional dances to the different performances and competitions, I have definitely learned a lot.. The amount of hard work put behind the scenes by each and every one of my juniors inspires me to get even better. Not only that but the relationships that we have formed over the years with the juniors and seniors are very important to me! I will definitely miss everyone and I hope that everyone will persevere no matter what happens!<br>-Chen Xin Yi,401 (President)*

  

*“For me, Chinese Dance has made my secondary school journey a lot more interesting. When I first joined, I was clueless. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do or how to do it. However, with the help of my seniors, I’ve adjusted well! Along the way, I also made new friends and learned from the tips given by them and my instructors. It is shocking that three and a half years had already flown by. I feel that there’s so much more to learn and do but with all the memories we’ve already created, I think that’s enough to make my experience here memorable and I will forever cherish them. Lastly, thank you everyone for making this CCA interesting and fun. Despite all the difficulties that we have faced together, we have achieved great success. This makes me feel proud and grateful for the opportunity to perform with the team! 加油!”<br>-Ang En Xi Grace,412 (Vice-President)*
