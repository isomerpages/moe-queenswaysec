#### Overview of the CCA:

Queensway’s Chinese Dance believes in nurturing the passion in dancing in our dancers. We believe in creating a light-hearted environment by encouraging our dancers and building up their confidence. Our CCA motto "To watch us dance, is to hear our hearts speak” reminds us to stay so ever passionate and committed to dancing. Our dancers get an array of experience being exposed to different styles of traditional dances. These dances would be showcased in internal school events like Chinese New Year celebration concerts, Speech Day and Nation Day concerts or external competitions like Singapore Youth Festival. Our training sessions help our dancers strengthen their techniques and maintain their flexibility. Long-lasting friendships and values such as teamwork perseverance and discipline are also formed between the dancers as they learn from each other. 


#### Achievements of the CCA:

Singapore Youth Festival (2021) Distinction

  

#### Student Experiences:

*“Honestly, being a part of Queensway Chinese Dance has been so fulfilling and rewarding. From the different types of traditional dances to the different performances and competitions, I have definitely learned a lot. I realised how much perseverance and teamwork there needed to be to showcase a dance. The amount of hard work put behind the scenes by each and every one of my juniors are admirable. Not only that but the relationships that we have formed over the years with the juniors and seniors are very heartwarming to see. Everyone comes in as strangers but leaves the CCA as family. I would have never thought being in Chinese Dance would have been something I adore so much and gotten so attached to. To my members, I have thoroughly enjoyed performing side by side with everyone of you, watching all of you improve a whole lot! I will definitely miss all the laughter about silly things and most importantly growing with y’all.I hope that everyone will persevere no matter what happens because I fully believe that y’all can do it! Continue working hard and y'all will do just fine:)<br>

“Being part of Chinese Dance is an unforgettable experience and I will surely cherish this experience for a lifetime. When I first became a member of Chinese Dance, I was clueless as I did not know anyone there. However, with the help of my seniors, I not only adjusted well to the CCA but also created new friendships. In addition, Chinese Dance has taught me many great values such as perseverance and confidence. Moreover, I was given an opportunity to take on a solo part in SYF2021. As many would say, taking on a solo part was definitely stressful since many people would expect me to do exceptionally well. With my teammates’ help and my instructors’ guidance, I was able to overcome the challenges which led to greater success for us.”
