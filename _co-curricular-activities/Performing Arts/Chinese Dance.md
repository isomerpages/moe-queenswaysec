#### Overview of the CCA:

Queensway’s Chinese Dance is committed to inculcating good values in our dancers, to train them to maximise their potential in terms of perseverance, responsibility and discipline. “To watch us dance, is to hear our heart speak” is the motto that is deeply rooted in us, reminding us of our passion and commitment to dancing. We believe in creating a joyful experience for all, by building our dancers’ confidence and encouraging each other along the way. Our dancers are exposed to various types of traditional dances, which they perform during major school events, such as the Chinese New Year Celebration Concert, Speech Day and National Day Concert. Our weekly training sessions help to develop our dancers’ flexibility and techniques. These dance sessions also help to build good rapport between seniors and juniors as they train and learn alongside each other.  


#### Achievements of the CCA:

Singapore Youth Festival (2021) Distinction

  

#### Student Experiences:

“Chinese Dance has helped build my confidence and has instilled in me the values of teamwork and responsibility through leadership opportunities. Chinese Dance is so much more than simply dancing. I realised how much confidence and courage it took to stand in front of an audience and how much teamwork and effort was needed to come up with an astonishing performance. I will surely cherish this experience for a lifetime.”  
<br> **Quek Ying Tong (403), President**

“Being part of Chinese Dance is an unforgettable experience and I will surely cherish this experience for a lifetime. When I first became a member of Chinese Dance, I was clueless as I did not know anyone there. However, with the help of my seniors, I not only adjusted well to the CCA but also created new friendships. In addition, Chinese Dance has taught me many great values such as perseverance and confidence. Moreover, I was given an opportunity to take on a solo part in SYF2021. As many would say, taking on a solo part was definitely stressful since many people would expect me to do exceptionally well. With my teammates’ help and my instructors’ guidance, I was able to overcome the challenges which led to greater success for us.”
