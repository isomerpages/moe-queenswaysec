#### Overview of the CCA:

Queensway’s Chinese Dance believes in nurturing the passion in dancing in our dancers. We believe in creating a light-hearted environment by encouraging our dancers and building up their confidence. Our CCA motto "To watch us dance, is to hear our hearts speak” reminds us to stay so ever passionate and committed to dancing. Our dancers get an array of experience being exposed to different styles of traditional dances. These dances would be showcased in internal school events like Chinese New Year celebration concerts, Speech Day and Nation Day concerts or external competitions like Singapore Youth Festival. Our training sessions help our dancers strengthen their techniques and maintain their flexibility. Long-lasting friendships and values such as teamwork perseverance and discipline are also formed between the dancers as they learn from each other. 


#### Achievements of the CCA:

Singapore Youth Festival (2021) Distinction

  

#### Student Experiences:

“Chinese Dance has helped build my confidence and has instilled in me the values of teamwork and responsibility through leadership opportunities. Chinese Dance is so much more than simply dancing. I realised how much confidence and courage it took to stand in front of an audience and how much teamwork and effort was needed to come up with an astonishing performance. I will surely cherish this experience for a lifetime.”  
<br> **Quek Ying Tong (403), President**

“Being part of Chinese Dance is an unforgettable experience and I will surely cherish this experience for a lifetime. When I first became a member of Chinese Dance, I was clueless as I did not know anyone there. However, with the help of my seniors, I not only adjusted well to the CCA but also created new friendships. In addition, Chinese Dance has taught me many great values such as perseverance and confidence. Moreover, I was given an opportunity to take on a solo part in SYF2021. As many would say, taking on a solo part was definitely stressful since many people would expect me to do exceptionally well. With my teammates’ help and my instructors’ guidance, I was able to overcome the challenges which led to greater success for us.”
