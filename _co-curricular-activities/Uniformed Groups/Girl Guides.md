<h4><strong>Achievement in 2024:</strong></h4>
<p>Gold Award</p>
<h4><strong>Overview of the CCA:</strong></h4>
<p>Queensway Girl Guides’ mission is to enable girls and young women to develop
their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world. In line with
our motto, “Be Prepared”, our activities are designed to nurture responsibility
and adaptability in our Guides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, our Guides continued to hone their leadership skills, via taking
the lead in Unit and Patrol activities relating to a range of current issues,
such as food sustainability, environmental conservation and cyber-wellness.
The highlight of the year was the Guides camp, which took place online.
Centred around the theme of “Finding Our Way Together”,&nbsp; the camp
aimed to help our Guides discover their strengths and forge stronger ties
as a Unit. Over the course of the camp, our Guides learned about the importance
of self-care, and showcased their creativity and talents in the areas of
handicraft and gastronomy.&nbsp;
