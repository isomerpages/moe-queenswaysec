#### Overview of the CCA:&nbsp;

The 61st Company aims to provide a holistic education for our boys outside&nbsp;of the classroom. Through our planned programs, we seek to develop each&nbsp;boyâ€™s leadership skills and character.&nbsp;

In 2022, we focused on increasing the engagement of our boys through outdoor and adventure activities. One highlight was the archery training sessions that our boys participated in. They also attended lessons on survival and campcraft skills, ranging from tying knots, pitching a basha and outdoor cooking, to map-reading and navigation. Our boys were given the opportunity to apply the skills that they learned in a virtual&nbsp;adventure challenge with other schools.
