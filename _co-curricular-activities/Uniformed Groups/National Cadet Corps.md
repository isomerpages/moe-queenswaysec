<p>Members are taught to display these core values during NCCâ€™s trainings
and camps. For instance, the core value of discipline must be adhered to
during our weekly training sessions. The cadets develop resilience as they
go through a series of physical conditioning exercises and strength training,
such as pushups, planks, and sit-ups to prepare themselves for their yearly
Physical Training test.</p>
<p>In <strong>2025</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1</strong> cadets participated in Camp F.O.R.G.E, where
they enjoyed fun and exciting activities such as the Flying Fox, Abseiling
and High Elements.</p>
<p>In Camp S.T.E.E.L, the<strong> Secondary 2</strong> cadets experience the
paintball 5-versus-5 match, where the Secondary 2 cadets learned the value
of teamwork, as they had to work together closely in order to achieve victory.</p>
<p>The cadets also have the chance in using the Air Rifle at the Yishun SAFRA.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 3</strong> Cadet Leaders stepped up to teach the Junior
Cadets and Senior Cadets key skills involved in the Total Defense Bronze
and Silver courses. As their Total Defence Gold, they have to make arrangement
to do their VIA with Rainbow Centre.</p>
<p>They were exposed to hands-on weapons training on the SAR-21, as well
as how to deal with gun jams. They have passed their IMT before they can
attend the 100 metres live range.</p>
<p>Suitable cadets would be selected to attend the Advanced Drill Instructors'
Course. In addition, they have to pass their Specialists Assessment Course
in order to qualify to attend the Senior Specialists Leadership Course.</p>
<p>Selected Senior Cadet Leaders would be selected to be in the Senior Leadership
Committee to lead the NCC Unit in school. Leadership selection and training
start as early as Secondary 2 so that leadership roles can be assigned
at the beginning of Secondary 3 before the Secondary 4 cadets step down
towards the end of term 2.</p>
