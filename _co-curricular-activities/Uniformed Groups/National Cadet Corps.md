#### Overview of the CCA:

Queensway Secondary School National Cadet Corps comprises more than 80 dedicated members.

Our core values are:

1\.   Loyalty to the country<br>
2\.   Uprightness<br>
3\.   Leadership<br>
4\.   Discipline<br>
5\.   Commitment and Responsibility<br>
6\.   Care for fellow cadets<br>
7\.   Adventurous spirit<br>
8\.   Safety.

  

Members are taught and display these core values during NCC’s trainings and camps. For instance, the core value of discipline must be adhered to during our weekly training sessions. The cadets develop resilience as they go through a series of physical conditioning exercises and strength training, such as pushups, planks, and sit-ups to prepare themselves for their yearly Physical Training test.

  

This year, our Secondary 1 cadets participated in Camp F.O.R.G.E, where they enjoyed fun and exciting activities such as the Flying Fox, Abseiling and High Elements. In Camp S.T.E.E.L, the Secondary 2 cadets were exposed to hands-on weapons training, where they learned how to dismantle and assemble the SAR-21, as well as how to deal with gun jams. Another highlight of Camp S.T.E.E.L was the paintball 5-versus-5 match, where the Secondary 2 cadets learned the value of teamwork, as they had to work together closely in order to achieve victory. Last but not least, the Secondary 3 cadets stepped up to teach their juniors key skills involved in the Total Defence Bronze and Silver courses, as part of their Total Defence Gold Course requirements.

  

#### Student Experiences: 


*"Throughout this year NCC has been able to resume many of our activities that were restricted during the covid period. Before that we had many restrictions and were not allowed to do many activities that were strenuous and involved having big groups of students or crossovering schools.<br> I remember that my own batch missed out on some of the exciting events such as camp which we did not get to experience. However, thankfully this year the restrictions have been lifted and we are able to resume some of the activities that we previously had before covid had come about. For example, our most recent activity that we partook in was the NCC sport championships where we sent our Secondary 1 and 3 cadets to compete in captain’s ball and football. <br><br>Although we did not manage to clench any achievements, it was still a good experience for our participants as we got more exposed to these activities which we did not have the chance to participate in during covid times. Another key highlight of this year for NCC was the National Day Observance Ceremony that was held at Queenstown stadium along with Bukit Merah Secondary School. It was also our first parade that we got to experience throughout our years in NCC as there was covid previously. This was truly an enriching experience as we got to learn about how we should carry ourselves during a parade as well as a chance for us to show off our drills that we had learnt. As I was a flag bearer, I was standing in a smaller contingent which was in the centre of the parade platoon. Knowing that more attention was going to be on us as we were the only contingent carrying flags, it definitely made me feel a little more pressured that if I made a mistake or slipped up, the crowd could easily spot that I wasn’t in sync or had done a drill wrongly. However, we had many rehearsals and our commanding officer was very kind to give us some tips and everyone in my contingent was really friendly and supportive of one another, even the flag bearers from the others school was also very participative and were not shy in communicating with the Queensway Secondary School flag bearers. <br><br>Personally, my favourite event that had happened this year was Queensway Secondary School’s own Observance Ceremony where all the respective Uniform Group Leaders came together to march to commemorate Singapore’s 57th Birthday as a school. Firstly, I felt like all the Uniform Group Leaders were very cooperative and we bonded well together as a team, not just in drills but also as friends. Everyone was really supportive of each other and even the teacher’s were encouraging us and giving us tips on how to carry ourselves better. I remember on the day of the parade, we were all very nervous but we kept pushing each other and tried to calm our nerves by giving each other supportive remarks. All in all, it was a fun memory that I had this year and I hope that my future cadets in NCC will get to experience having similar or even better experiences than us."<br>

<br>*"When I joined the National Cadet Corps,I did not have any expectations whatsoever. However,throughout the three years of me being in the National Cadet Corps, I’ve soon realized that the National Cadet Corps is more than just a uniformed group. Before I had known it, the National Cadet Corps taught me values that couldn’t be taught elsewhere such as Uprightness, Leadership, Discipline and Responsibility.One of the events that taught me about leadership was when I attended Camp STEEL.<br><br>At camp STEEL,I remembered that I was first person to get chosen to rappel, I think that really gave me a sense of confidence as well as leadership due to the fact that I had to take charge. Camp STEEL also taught me the values of discipline and responsibility as there is a specific way of assembling and disassembling the SAR-21, they also gave us different types of scenarios whereby the rifle is clogged or when there is difficulty handling the rifles. Through that, I had learnt and understand the values of discipline and responsibility. <br><br>Another event that I went for is the Queenstown Observance Ceremony, through that, they taught us the importance of synchronizing with our fellow uniform groups from others schools, it taught us that due to the fact that, there was a command that we had to stop on the 14th step, it was difficult to execute and it took us one hour and 30 minutes to execute it perfectly. On top of that, we also had to march according to the beat of the drums, everyone was confused at first but we overcame it. Last but not least, there was also the National Cadet Corps Sport championship whereby we had to compete with other schools through various types of sports such as football and captain’s ball. Even though we lost in football, it taught us that teamwork and communication is key as we had to communicate when to pass,attack and defend. Overall, I am grateful that I had the opportunity to join the National Cadet Corps as they had imparted me the values of uprightness, leadership, discipline and responsibility."<br>~Dario*

*"It was unfortunate that the year we entered secondary school, COVID had its first major outbreak and severely impacted SIngapore. Restrictions were imposed, and we even had a lockdown that forced us to remain at home for a few months. As a result of these restrictions, a lot of our CCA activities were cut short or cancelled entirely. In 2021 onwards, these restrictions eased and we were able to attend more events. One of the key events was Camp STEEL. It was the first time we were going to NCC HQ for an activity, after not being able to attend Camp FORGE in 2020. It allowed us to really bond together for the first time through activities such as paintball and the SAR-21 technical handling. There was also rappelling, where some of my NCC-mates had a fear of heights and did not want to rappel down, from 3 storeys up. Those who were at the bottom comforted them and gave them the confidence to rappel down. I think that activity really helped us forge stronger bonds with each other and we were more comfortable with working with each other after the camp. <br><br>Another memorable event was the Senior Specialist Leader’s Course, a program to hone the leadership skills of NCC student leaders. The first day taught us skills in how to lead the CCA better, as well as how to handle any difficulties with ease. The second day required us to head to NCC HQ to work with other NCC members with various schools. We took part in fun activities, like urban combat drills. The SSLC also required us to take charge and lead our group mates through certain activities. One such activity was learning how to construct an 8-man tent. It was the sort of tent that had heavy metal parts that made up the frame of the tent. We had absolutely no experience constructing that kind of tent and simply had to go through a process of trial-and-error to learn how to construct it properly. Due to the heavy metal poles, several people had to be holding up one pole while the others scurried to connect the right pieces together. Even though we had our share of laughter and jokes, we had also learnt how to work together to overcome hardships. It was also quite funny how our facilitator told us to deconstruct it almost after we finally finished constructing it, and we were all complaining after that. Besides bonding with my fellow NCC-mates, SSLC was able to impart to me essential leadership skills and experience to better lead my CCA. All in all, NCC had given me many opportunities to improve my confidence in leading others and gave me invaluable experiences that I will carry with me."<br>~Xaviar*
