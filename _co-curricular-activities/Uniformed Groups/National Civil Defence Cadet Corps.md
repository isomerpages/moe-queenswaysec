#### Overview of the CCA: 

The National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) provides first-aid and other related services to the school and the public. The NCDCC cadets render first-aid duties during school activities such as the Cross Country Meet, Annual Speech Day and Annual Sport Meet. NCDCC aims to empower our cadets to be active and concerned citizens equipped with life-saving skills, in order for them to respond effectively to emergencies at home and abroad.

In 2022, along with the relaxation of COVID-19 SMM measures, NCDCC cadets were offered the opportunity to physically participate in the National Precision Drill Challenge Competition and Specialization Courses. This was on top of the various Learning Journeys to both the Civil Defence Heritage Gallery and Alexandra Fire Station where cadets got to learn about the history of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the intricate operations run by SCDF.

#### Student Experiences:

*“Despite all the challenges faced throughout 2021,I feel that our contingent  has put in their utmost effort to organise and participate in all the NCDCC activities. We have worked together as a team to achieve our goals. I cannot thank the entire NCDCC committee enough for all their hard work and dedication. I am looking forward to a refreshing 2022!” 
<br> Kumaseran Harshini Hirthika (304), Overall In-Charge* 

  

*“Being part of NCDCC has been a great experience for me during my years in Queensway. I have learnt a lot, ranging from leadership to communication and other life skills. Even though I have fewer opportunities to meet with my fellow cadets and attend CCA amidst this COVID pandemic, I still enjoyed NCDCC very much. One of my favourite moments in NCDCC was when we were teaching our juniors foot drills, as we got to know them better.”
