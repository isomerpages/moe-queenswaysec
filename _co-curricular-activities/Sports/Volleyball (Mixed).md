<h4>Overview of the CCA:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Our Volleyball teams demonstrate Excellence not just through their success
on national platforms, but also through the sheer grit and resilience that
Queensway seeks to cultivate in our players. Our players do not just learn
Volleyball skills, but also about the importance of teamwork and about
cultivating a strong and resilient mindset. It is this foundation that
has led to our successes over the years.</p>

<h5>Student Experiences:</h5>
<p>The most memorable experience I had in my CCA was the time we participated
in an external competition together. At the end, after a hard fought finals,
we emerged as second place. It was a tough loss, the amount of time and
effort put into the match made it one, at least for me. However, our team
was still supportive of each other and did not let this loss dampen our
spirits, using it to spur us forwards instead. This show of camaraderie
and resilience is something I hold dear to me even after I have stepped
down.</p>

<p>In my time as vice-captain of the girls’ team, I have made countless fond
memories with my teammates, coaches, and teachers that i will forever look
back upon with a smile. For instance, after our c-division National School
Game finals in 2022, where we obtained 1st place, we decided to celebrate
with a potluck dinner, where we had fun and laughed all night in each other's
company. We have since made it a tradition to have a potluck after every
competition season, regardless of the outcome, to enjoy the close bonds
that we have all made over the years.</p>
