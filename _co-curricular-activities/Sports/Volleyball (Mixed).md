<h4>Overview of the CCA:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Queensway Volleyball Team is more than a sports CCA — it nurtures
discipline, teamwork, and resilience. In 2025, our players participated
in the National School Games, Queenscup, and friendly leagues, achieving
commendable results in both B and C Divisions. Beyond competitions, CCA
Camp and Bonding Day strengthened our unity and sense of belonging. Through
balancing training and academics, our players grow as disciplined student-athletes,
confident leaders, and lifelong learners.</p>

<h5>Student Experiences:</h5>
<p>The most memorable experience I had in my CCA was the time we participated
in an external competition together. At the end, after a hard fought finals,
we emerged as second place. It was a tough loss, the amount of time and
effort put into the match made it one, at least for me. However, our team
was still supportive of each other and did not let this loss dampen our
spirits, using it to spur us forwards instead. This show of camaraderie
and resilience is something I hold dear to me even after I have stepped
down.</p>
<p>– Lizabeth Jesibel Tukiman</p>
<p></p>
<p>In my time as vice-captain of the girls’ team, I have made countless fond
memories with my teammates, coaches, and teachers that i will forever look
back upon with a smile. For instance, after our c-division National School
Game finals in 2022, where we obtained 1st place, we decided to celebrate
with a potluck dinner, where we had fun and laughed all night in each other's
company. We have since made it a tradition to have a potluck after every
competition season, regardless of the outcome, to enjoy the close bonds
that we have all made over the years.</p>
