<h3>Overview of CCA:</h3>
<p>We believe in working hard and training together as a team. A cooperative
team spirit must be cultivated both on and off the court. We also believe
in developing resilience, an essential 21st Century Competency. At the
end of their QSS journey, we want to establish future-ready citizens who
can contribute to society.</p>

<h3>Achievement in 2023:</h3>
<p>4th Placing in Zonal C Boys</p>
<h3>Student Experiences:</h3>
<p>I struggled initially when I joined the Basketball team as I was still
a relatively novice player. However, I was determined to hone my skills
and train hard. After years of practice, I can proudly say that I have
become just as good as my teammates! 2022 was our final chance to compete
in a national tournament. This year, every single one of us gave our paramount
effort. We trained our hardest as we were determined to win. On the first
day of the competition, we were all excited and nervous at the same time.
Four years of hard work and training for this moment! We decided to give
it our all. As a team, we managed to get to the quarterfinals. This impressive
feat was only achievable because of our tremendous amount of commitment
and support from coach and teachers. It has been four remarkable years
being in the Basketball CCA. It has definitely been an amazing experience
and I will treasure these memories for the rest of my life.</p>
