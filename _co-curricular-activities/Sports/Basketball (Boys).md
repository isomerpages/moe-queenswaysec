<h3>Student Experiences:</h3>
<p>I struggled initially when I joined the Basketball team as I was still
a relatively novice player. However, I was determined to hone my skills
and train hard. After years of practice, I can proudly say that I have
become just as good as my teammates! This year was our final chance to
compete in a national tournament. Every single one of us gave our paramount
effort. We trained our hardest as we were determined to win. On the first
day of the competition, we were all excited and nervous at the same time.
Four years of hard work and training for this moment! We decided to give
it our all. As a team, we managed to get to the quarterfinals. This impressive
feat was only achievable because of our tremendous amount of commitment
and support from coach and teachers. It has been four remarkable years
being in the Basketball CCA. It has definitely been an amazing experience
and I will treasure these memories for the rest of my life.</p>
