STUDENT EXPERIENCE: 

  

‘I like Cross Country as it has helped me maintain a healthier lifestyle as a student, especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic where we had to resume CCA sessions online. Back then I was not very physically active. Cross Country has also trained my stamina both physically and mentally as it takes a lot of perseverance to thrive in this CCA. What I really like about Cross Country is how it has taught me to keep pushing on and to strive for the best.’

Jeremiah Noel Lee (403)


‘I like Cross Country because I get to step out of my comfort zone to do things I never thought I would do such as taking part in competitions as well as having a chance to get a leadership position. These opportunities have allowed me to learn and experience more things and improve myself. Not only that, the memories and friendships made everything enjoyable.’

Thong Xuan (403)
