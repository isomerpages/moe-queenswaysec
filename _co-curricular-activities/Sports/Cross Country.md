#### Overview of the CCA: 

Cross Country aims to nurture students’ holistic development. To this end, our programmes are designed to develop students’ values of discipline, self-management and perseverance. 

Students were given opportunities to take part in races to challenge them and further their development as athletes. One such event was the Inter-School Mileage Run 2021. We look forward to training as a team in person in 2022, and improving ourselves as runners!

  

#### Student Experiences: 

“I really enjoyed my experience in Cross Country! I enjoyed training together with my friends. It kept me fit and helped me improve in my time management, as I learnt how to juggle both school and CCA commitments.” 
<br> **Nicole Tan Hwee Ming (403), Captain, Girls’ Cross Country** 

  

“I am extremely proud to have overcome obstacles and become the runner I am now. Even though training was tough and tiring, I am glad that I persisted. I have a stronger appreciation of the values of discipline and diligence, as they have helped me improve. I am elated to make our school proud by qualifying to be the only finalist in the national cohort!”

“Cross Country has taught me many valuable lessons. It has given me opportunities to step out of my comfort zone and push my limits. I have not only become a better runner; I have also developed in terms of becoming a more disciplined and determined person. In Secondary 4, I participated in the Inter-School Mileage Run 2021, and I completed the race in less than 22 minutes, despite having a short runway to prepare for the competition. This has boosted my confidence as an athlete. Cross Country has made me a fitter and more adaptable person.” 
<br> **Tiang Yi Xi (404)**

  

“Cross Country can be tiring, but it is also an interesting CCA, as I learnt new ways to train and increase my fitness. I enjoyed having the freedom to set targets for myself. It was also fun challenging myself to achieve those goals, as they motivated me to train hard.”
