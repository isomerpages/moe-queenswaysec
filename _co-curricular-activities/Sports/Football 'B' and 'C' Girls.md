#### Overview of the CCA: 

Due to the Covid-19 situation, we were unable to compete in school competitions. Yet, the girls remained resilient and enthusiastic in the face of these challenges. They continued to train diligently under the guidance of their coach, Ms Merah. We are proud of six of our Football girls, who were included in the National U-16 football team.

In Semester 2, in-person training was replaced by virtual Zoom sessions as we transitioned from the field to e-CCA. Nevertheless, the girls are looking forward to returning to the field and competitive football in 2022. 

  

#### Student Experiences:

“Football has taught me the value of determination. While there may be obstacles along the way, I should persevere through them, as these are opportunities for me to learn and grow.” 
<br> **Ariesa Zahran Binte Junaidi (304), Football ‘B’ Girls’ Vice-Captain**

  

“I learnt that football is about teamwork and it is important to have lots of communication with one another, both on and off the field. This is so we can understand each other better and improve our performance as a team.” 
<br> **Irsalina Irwan (311)**

  

“In these 2 years, I have learnt lots of new skills from being part of the Girls’ Football team. I have learnt how to play and work better with teammates. I really enjoyed the many bonding games and activities organised for us - they were so much fun!”
<br>**Crystal Wu (212)**
