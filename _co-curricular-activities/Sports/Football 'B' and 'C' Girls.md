#### Overview of the CCA: 

2022 was a good year for the girls as they were able to get to look forward to the National Sports Games (NSG) after a two year wait. The girls had worked hard in the beginning of the year to prepare themselves. There was great enthusiasm and spirit. From a squad of 33 players, 20 were chosen to represent the school in the National School Games. (NSG). Three of our players, Qarissa, Bernice and Abigail were also selected to be part of the National Football Academy (NFA) programme.  

#### Student Experiences:

“Football has taught me the value of determination. While there may be obstacles along the way, I should persevere through them, as these are opportunities for me to learn and grow.” 
<br> **Ariesa Zahran Binte Junaidi (304), Football ‘B’ Girls’ Vice-Captain**

  

“I learnt that football is about teamwork and it is important to have lots of communication with one another, both on and off the field. This is so we can understand each other better and improve our performance as a team.” 
<br> **Irsalina Irwan (311)**

  

“In these 2 years, I have learnt lots of new skills from being part of the Girls’ Football team. I have learnt how to play and work better with teammates. I really enjoyed the many bonding games and activities organised for us - they were so much fun!”
