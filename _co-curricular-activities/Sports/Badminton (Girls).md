<h3>Overview of the CCA:</h3>
<p>Our C Division team celebrated another achievement in the League 2 NSG,
showing resilience and determination on court. Beyond competitions, Bonding
Day strengthened unity and teamwork within the CCA. Student leaders also
had meaningful opportunities to lead during the Open House, CCA Showcase,
and Sec 1 CCA Fair, representing the CCA with pride. Through the NSG competition
and friendly matches, the team gained valuable experience while consistently
demonstrating sportsmanship and respect for their opponents.</p>

<h3>Student Experiences:</h3>
<p>'Being the captain for the past 3 years has been such a fulfilling experience.
Given that my batch was the first batch for the relatively new CCA, it
made me proud to watch them grow from when they were just beginners to
players who now have a passion for the sport. They showed me that despite
hardships, like losing a match or not being on your game that day, they
would continue to move forward, working on how to improve their skills
further and reach the standard they set for themselves.’</p>
<p><strong><em>Captain, Tan Yu-Qi</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‘For the past 1 year, I have learned many new skills like footwork and
stroke techniques. This gives me a sense of satisfaction, confidence, and
a thrill of motivation that I look forward to in every training session.
In Sec 1, I was involved in the school open house where I worked with seniors
to manage the CCA booth and attended to any queries from the visitors.
This event has allowed me to understand the importance of communication
and gradually improve myself to become a better communicator. I will continue
to lead the team well and develop the team in the joy of learning in this
sport.’</p>
