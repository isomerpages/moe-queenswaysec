<h3>Overview of the CCA:</h3>
<p>Badminton is one of the popular CCAs offered at Queensway. Our girls go
through a rigorous developmental training program to learn fundamental
skills in the sport, laying the foundation for further progression.</p>

<p>Our team took part in the annual National School Games (NSG) and demonstrated
sportsmanship, perseverance, and resilience, with our ‘C’ Girls’ Division
team making it to the quarterfinals in the South Zone NSG Competitions.
The team has shown a great attitude, and we hope that in time to come,
they will continue to show enthusiasm and a spirit of learning as they
strive for even greater heights.</p>

<h3>Student Experiences:</h3>
<p>'Being the captain for the past 3 years has been such a fulfilling experience.
Given that my batch was the first batch for the relatively new CCA, it
made me proud to watch them grow from when they were just beginners to
players who now have a passion for the sport. They showed me that despite
hardships, like losing a match or not being on your game that day, they
would continue to move forward, working on how to improve their skills
further and reach the standard they set for themselves.’</p>
<p><strong><em>Captain, Tan Yu-Qi </em></strong>
</p>
<p>‘For the past 1 year, I have learned many new skills like footwork and
stroke techniques. This gives me a sense of satisfaction, confidence, and
a thrill of motivation that I look forward to in every training session.
In Sec 1, I was involved in the school open house where I worked with seniors
to manage the CCA booth and attended to any queries from the visitors.
This event has allowed me to understand the importance of communication
and gradually improve myself to become a better communicator. I will continue
to lead the team well and develop the team in the joy of learning in this
sport.’</p>
