Sepak Takraw aspires to inculcate values such as discipline, responsibility, respect and diligence through rigorous training. This year, the team took part in the Sepak Takraw National Inter-School Championship. This experience added significant values to the boys’ experience and we hope the boys will continue to exhibit such qualities even after leaving school.
