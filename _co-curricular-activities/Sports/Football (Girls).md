#### Overview of the CCA:&nbsp;

At Queensway, we believe that the Beautiful Game should be enjoyed by everybody. Our Football (Girls) team embodies the school's values of Excellence, Discipline, Respect and Responsibility through their actions on and off the pitch. In 2022, our C Division Girls were national finalists while their seniors emerged as National Champions.

Outside of rigorous training sessions, the girls have numerous opportunities to develop their skills and talents in the sport. Numerous Queenswayans have represented the nation in age-group football and we are also proud that some have even been called up to the senior national team. In 2022, Irsalina bte Irwan was recognised as the 2022 Sportsgirl of the Year (Football) at the 52nd National School Sports Colours Award ceremony.

#### Student Experiences:

*“Football has taught me the value of determination. While there may be obstacles along the way, I should persevere through them, as these are opportunities for me to learn and grow.”&nbsp;
<br> ~Ariesa Zahran Binte Junaidi (404), Football ‘B’ Girls’ Vice-Captain*

  

*“I learnt that football is about teamwork and it is important to have lots of communication with one another, both on and off the field. This is so we can understand each other better and improve our performance as a team.”&nbsp;
<br> ~Irsalina Irwan (411)*


*“In these 2 years, I have learnt lots of new skills from being part of the Girls’ Football team. I have learnt how to play and work better with teammates. I really enjoyed the many bonding games and activities organised for us - they were so much fun!”
<br>~Crystal Wu (312)*
