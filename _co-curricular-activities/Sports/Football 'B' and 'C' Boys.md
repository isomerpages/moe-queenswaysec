2021 was a difficult year for the Boys’ Football team. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to participate in the National School Games or the other tournaments that we usually compete in. 

  

However, there were still some bright moments in the year. We welcomed our new Secondary One cohort, who impressed us with their vigour and enthusiasm even during these tough times. 

  

We also said farewell to our Secondary Four cohort, and while it is unfortunate that they could not lead us out in the National School Games one more time, we thank them for their leadership and effort, and wish them all the best for their national exams. 

  

Finally, Queensway Secondary Boys’ Football team will be participating in an MOE training pilot over the school holidays, and we are excited to have the opportunity to train together in person once again. We look forward to 2022 and to show the fruits of our training in competition once more.

  

#### Student Experiences:

“I am thankful to Coach Dilwant, Mr Yam, and Mr Aaron for their encouragement and guidance. Their support has helped me grow and develop to the best of my abilities, both as a football player and as an individual.”
