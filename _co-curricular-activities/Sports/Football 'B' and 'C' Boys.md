2022 proved to be an eventful year for the boys. They had been training very hard through the December holidays and were engaged in an intensive ActiveSg futsal tournament in February and March this year in preparation for the National School Games (NSG). Out of our squad of 29 players, 23 were selected to represent the school. The boys were confident of playing well for the school and were focused and disciplined in achieving their goals.

We took in 8 Direct School Admission (DSA) boys this year. At the same time 23 of our squad of 36 players were in Secondary 1. The final team of 20 selected to represent the school comprised 12 Secondary 1 students and 8 Secondary 2 students. The players went through rigorous preparation training. They were also involved in an ActiveSg futsal tournament in Term 1 to prepare them for the tournament. The school was also excited to be part of the Unleash the Roar – an initiative to identify and develop young talent in Singapore schools. 19 students were identified and came under the School Football Academy (SFA) programme. Our captain Travis was selected as one of the players under this programme to travel to Munich and Madrid from 5th November to 3rd December 2022. We wish him all the best and we will continue to support this programme going forward.
