#### Overview of the CCA:

The Hockey CCA promotes the partnership between Queensway Secondary School and ACS (Barker Road) where both schools are represented in the National School Games as one combined team. This unique partnership allows not one but two combined teams to be represented in the National School Games. Although the boys come from two schools with different cultures and backgrounds, both share the common aim to participate in the spirit of friendship and camaraderie.

#### Student Experiences:

*“I felt very privileged to be in the first batch of this CCA. The training was strenuous and lugging home our heavy school bags and tired bodies was no mean feat but the laughter and fun we shared was enough to make up for it. <br>
The current COVID-19 pandemic shifted our training online as we were confined to our homes. However this did not hamper the coaches or teachers-in-charge from making training enjoyable. Thanks to their persistent efforts, I could stay active. Looking back, I have no regrets joining hockey.”
<br> Mavyinjeet Singh Gill (301)*

  

*“My journey in QSS Hockey is really amazing. When I first came for the CCA trials, I had close to no experience in playing hockey. My dad used to play hockey but I was more into playing football. Since my school offered hockey, I decided to give it a shot and my dad was also very happy that I was taking up a sport that he loved as well. After finding out that it is a partnership between QSS and ACSBR, I was expecting tension between the two schools. Instead, we developed and adapted ourselves to be one team. Furthermore we gave and received unconditional support. 
I have made wonderful “brothers” and memories both in QSS and ACSBR. As the Captain, I am truly honoured to be a part of this team. Hockey is now a part of me and it will stick with me forever.”
<br> Surveen Singh Shahi (303)*

  

*“I shared many wonderful experiences with my teammates and friends but most importantly we all worked hard to become skillful hockey players. We will not give up no matter what difficulties we face and we are working towards becoming the best role models and players for our juniors and the team! You're never a loser until you quit trying."
<br> Mohamed Hariz (211)*

  

*“My experience in hockey began in Cantonment Primary School where I won a medal in the National School Games. My interest and potential in the sport have since grown as I am developing more skills. I have also made many new friends.”
