#### Overview of the CCA:

It has been another very exciting year for QSS Hockey. Our partnership with ACSBR continues to strengthen post Covid.

The B Division boys had a very good run this year. The commendable showing during the National School Games (NSG) has inspired the C Division in their journey towards success. The pioneer batch who is graduating this year, has paved the way for the juniors to put their best foot forward in training and competitions.

This has led to the first top 4 finish for ACSBR-QSS in the NSG C Division Competition. Knocking out St Hilda’s Secondary School and finishing with a 1-1 draw against Victoria School in the 2nd round was the start of our battle forward. Showing our challenging semifinalist Raffles Institution that we are no pushovers (losing to them 1-0 with the goal coming in the last minute of the game!) and finally overcoming hockey giants like St Andrew’s SS in the 3rd and 4th placing match will surely be counted as a major achievement for QSS Hockey.

Under the combined programme we also participated in the Singapore Hockey Pesta Sukan 5-a-side competition with one of our teams emerging runners-up in the U-15 category.

The CCA is moving in the right direction. We will continue to pursue success and bring glory to QSS in this sports partnership programme.

We thank our School Leaders and our partners Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) and SportsSg for continued success in this programme.

#### Student Experiences:

*“I felt very privileged to be in the first batch of this CCA. The training was strenuous and lugging home our heavy school bags and tired bodies was no mean feat but the laughter and fun we shared was enough to make up for it. <br>
The current COVID-19 pandemic shifted our training online as we were confined to our homes. However this did not hamper the coaches or teachers-in-charge from making training enjoyable. Thanks to their persistent efforts, I could stay active. Looking back, I have no regrets joining hockey.”
<br> Mavyinjeet Singh Gill (301)*

  

*“My journey in QSS Hockey is really amazing. When I first came for the CCA trials, I had close to no experience in playing hockey. My dad used to play hockey but I was more into playing football. Since my school offered hockey, I decided to give it a shot and my dad was also very happy that I was taking up a sport that he loved as well. After finding out that it is a partnership between QSS and ACSBR, I was expecting tension between the two schools. Instead, we developed and adapted ourselves to be one team. Furthermore we gave and received unconditional support. 
I have made wonderful “brothers” and memories both in QSS and ACSBR. As the Captain, I am truly honoured to be a part of this team. Hockey is now a part of me and it will stick with me forever.”
<br> Surveen Singh Shahi (303)*

  

*“I shared many wonderful experiences with my teammates and friends but most importantly we all worked hard to become skillful hockey players. We will not give up no matter what difficulties we face and we are working towards becoming the best role models and players for our juniors and the team! You're never a loser until you quit trying."
<br> Mohamed Hariz (211)*

  

*“My experience in hockey began in Cantonment Primary School where I won a medal in the National School Games. My interest and potential in the sport have since grown as I am developing more skills. I have also made many new friends.”
