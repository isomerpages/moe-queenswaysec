Our Football Boys team seek to embody the school's values of Excellence, Respect, Responsibility and Discipline. In 2022, we reached the finals of the B Division competition of the National School Games and was also recognised with the Fair Play Award. 

Our boys undergo rigorous training to develop their skills and talent for the game. They are also given numerous opportunities to take part in competitions beyond the NSG and we are proud that a number of Queenswayans have been selected for national age-group squads.
