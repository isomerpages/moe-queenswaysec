<p>Our Football teams seek to embody the school's values of Excellence, Respect,
Responsibility and Discipline.</p>
<p>Both boys and girls undergo rigorous training to develop their skills
and talent for the game. They are also given numerous opportunities to
take part in competitions beyond the NSG and we are proud that a number
of Queenswayans have been selected for national age-group squads.</p>

<h4>Student Experiences:</h4>
<p><em>“Football has taught me the value of determination. While there may be obstacles along the way, I should persevere through them, as these are opportunities for me to learn and grow.”&nbsp;<br>~Ariesa Zahran Binte Junaidi (404), Football ‘B’ Girls’ Vice-Captain</em>
</p>
<p><em>“I learnt that football is about teamwork and it is important to have lots of communication with one another, both on and off the field. This is so we can understand each other better and improve our performance as a team.”&nbsp;<br>~Irsalina Irwan (411)</em>
</p>
<p><em>“In these 2 years, I have learnt lots of new skills from being part of the Girls’ Football team. I have learnt how to play and work better with teammates. I really enjoyed the many bonding games and activities organised for us - they were so much fun!”<br>~Crystal Wu (312)</em>
