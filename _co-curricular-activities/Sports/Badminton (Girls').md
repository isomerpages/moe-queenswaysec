#### Overview of the CCA:   

Badminton is a newer CCA offered in Queensway. Our girls go through a rigorous developmental training programme to learn fundamental skills in the sport to lay the foundation for further progression.

In 2022, our team took part in the annual National School Games and demonstrated sportsmanship, perseverance and resilience. Whilst the team are still relative novices, they have shown a great attitude and we hope that in time to come, they will continue to show enthusiasm and a spirit of learning as they strive for even greater heights.

#### Student Experiences:
  
‘The best memory was winning our first match as a team in the C Division competition. It was an accomplishment as we are a new team without experience. Besides this, the debriefing session after matches allows the team to reflect on their gameplay and learn from the mistakes made. With a positive mindset, I believe that the team will continue to improve and succeed in future.’

‘A meaningful experience in my CCA was when I was tasked to lead the whole team in the warm-up session during training. I was also involved in the Sec 1 trial selection. I learnt to lead and take responsibility in carrying out tasks. We will strive to keep improving and make the school proud!’
