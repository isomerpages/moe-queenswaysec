#### Overview of the CCA:

The Infocomm Technology (Media Production) Club is a relatively new CCA, having been formed from the merger of the old Infocomm and AVA Clubs. The Club aims to provide a fun and meaningful environment for students to develop and strengthen their technological insights, with a focus on digital media, game development, basic programming skills, and audio visual support for the school. Additionally, the club also cultivates leadership, entrepreneurship, and community service skills.&nbsp;  

The student leaders conducted a variety of courses in Semester One for the junior club members. Among the courses conducted was an introduction to smartphone photography, covering all aspects of the photographic process from composition and lighting to editing and post-production. Club members also learned programming using various programming languages such as Arduino, HTML and CSS.

In Semester Two, the Club participated in the prestigious Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Youth programme run by tech giant Intel and the Infocomm Media Development Authority. This helped developed their technical and social skills through interactive lessons that included games, Python programming activities, and group discussions. They also learned about important concepts such as AI ethics and privacy, as well as having exposure to no-code tools so as to establish a solid systems thinking mindset before writing code.

  

Concurrently, the Club also provided audio-visual support for school events, including major events such as the school’s Inaugural Assembly, Speech Day and the launch of the 60th Anniversary 60 Million Steps Challenge. In-house training was also conducted through quizzes and hands-on sessions, increasing members’ competency in handling the various equipment.

  

#### Student Experiences:  

“The experiences I had from the courses in Semester 1 and 2 were very fruitful. I learnt skills that allowed me to use different programmes, was exposed to technology-related current affairs and learned how to stay safe while using technology. The courses also expanded my interest in making games using code and I was able to use the new coding skills that I learnt to make my coding projects more interesting.”
