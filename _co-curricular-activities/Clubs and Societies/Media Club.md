<h4>Overview of the CCA:</h4>
<p>2025 was an exciting year of growth and creativity for Media Club. Our
members took part in several courses that helped them learn new skills
and grow in confidence. They started with a Podcast and Video Shorts Production
Course, where they learned the basics of video production and how to tell
engaging stories. In a Mobile Videography Course, members picked up journalistic
skills such as interviewing, questioning, and storyboarding. Using these
skills, they created videos that captured the experiences of students in
other CCAs through interviews and footage of their activities.</p>
<p>A key milestone for the club was the first year we submitted videos to
the National Our School Our Stories Photo and Video Competition, having
previously focused mainly on photographs. This marked an important step
forward and reflected the progression of our members’ skills in video production.
Members also learned about digital marketing through a Social Media Video
Production course, which taught them how to create videos for online audiences.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, we are excited and hopeful to build on these achievements,
take on new challenges, and create even more meaningful and inspiring stories
in the coming year.</p>

<h4>Student Experiences:</h4>
<p>“The experiences I had from the courses in Semester 1 and 2 were very
fruitful. I learnt skills that allowed me to use different programmes,
was exposed to technology-related current affairs and learned how to stay
safe while using technology. The courses also expanded my interest in making
games using code and I was able to use the new coding skills that I learnt
to make my coding projects more interesting.”
