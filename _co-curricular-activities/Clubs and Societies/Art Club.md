#### Overview of the CCA:

This year, the Art Club embarked on the Wall Mural Painting Project, which spanned two months. Our members brainstormed ideas and worked as a team to come up with the design and paint the mural. Besides that, the Club took part in school-related activities, such as designing a T-shirt for the 60th Anniversary, participating in Logo Design competitions and creating souvenirs for school functions. Additionally, members participated in external competitions like the Organ Donation Awareness Art Competition and SYF goes Online 2021 Art Labs. These activities provide opportunities for our members to showcase their creativity, as well as develop their character, leadership and communication skills.  

  

#### Achievements of the CCA:

#### Student Experiences:

“Throughout my three years in Queensway Secondary School’s Art Club, I have learnt various skills and acquired new knowledge, ranging from ceramics, mural painting to digital drawing.  It is truly an enriching journey for me and my fellow members.  Being an Art Club member has helps me to develop practical skills like drawing wavy and continuous lines and improve my dexterity in drawing. We are inspired to expand our creativity, experiment with new mediums and create our own unique masterpieces.”  
<br> **Amabelle Beh (304), President**

‘Splashes of paint line the school walls. Behind every stroke lies everyone's effort, and rooted deeper is an untold story. What drew me towards the Art Club was my love for art, but what made me stay was how the Art Club felt like family. Throughout our long journey, I've learnt many skills which gave me the chance to express myself. To me, that is the most valuable experience that I truly appreciate.’  
<br> **Leong Yu Ki (304), Vice-President**   

‘This is my second year with the Art Club and I have learnt a lot from my teachers and seniors. I have made so many new friends in the Art Club and I believe my Art has improved with the help of my teachers and fellow club members.’
