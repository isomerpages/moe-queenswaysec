#### Overview of the CCA:   

Despite some massive challenges in 2021, the Library Club managed to have a meaningful and exciting year. The main Library has had to be closed for most of the year due to renovations, but the Club helped set up a temporary Library space to continue to serve the reading needs of the Queensway population. Library Club students received training in information literacy befitting their status as media literacy experts in the school. The Club also focused heavily on outreach and publicity efforts this year by massively developing the Library's social media presence. The Library Instagram account (qss\_libraryclub) has grown tremendously, doubling the number of followers and promoting reading to the school through book sharings and reviews and themed posts.

#### Achievements of the CCA:

#### Student Experiences: 

"I am honoured to be the Chair of the Library Club. Although we are a small CCA, we have an important role in creating and supporting the reading culture of the school. I have enjoyed leading my juniors in helping to build this culture, and I look forward to our main Library reopening so we can reach more Queenswayans!"
