#### Overview of the CCA:   

The Library Club is very excited to take custodianship of The Lexicon, Queensway’s brand-new Library of the Future in the coming year. The Library will feature dedicated spaces for collaborative discussions, performances, quiet study and of course a wide collection of quality fiction and non-fiction books and periodicals.

Our Student Librarians support the development of a strong reading culture at Queensway by focusing on three key areas: Organisation, Research and Outreach. They learn to classify and display materials in a logical and engaging way; are role models for media literacy and information gathering; and promote Library activities through platforms such as the Library Instagram account.

#### Student Experiences: 

"I am honoured to be the Chair of the Library Club. Although we are a small CCA, we have an important role in creating and supporting the reading culture of the school. I have enjoyed leading my juniors in helping to build this culture, and I look forward to our main Library reopening so we can reach more Queenswayans!"
