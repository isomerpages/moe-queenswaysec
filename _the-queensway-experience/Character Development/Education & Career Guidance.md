### Education &amp; Career Guidance

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of pro-activity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century which is in line with our school mission to provide a holistic education to nurture caring, responsible citizens and confident, life-long learners in a changing world.
