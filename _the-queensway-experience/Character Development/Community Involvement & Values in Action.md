### Community Involvement & Values-in-Action

In line with our School’s Vision and Mission in moulding our students into caring citizens, well thought through programmes and activities are planned for all students from Secondary 1 to 4. A strong and vibrant 9- member team comprising of teachers from various disciplines, plans, implements and assesses all VIA programmes. The team identifies a focus for each level and programmes are planned to achieve the level focus. The 3Rs (Ready, Render, and Reflection) process is used to plan and execute the programmes.

In addition, the team creates signature programmes to promote volunteerism so as to encourage passionate students to serve, care and benefit others such as our inaugural VIA Service Learning cum cultural immersion trip to Siem Reap, Cambodia involving 31 students and 4 teachers was organised in June 2014.
