<p><strong>Student Leadership @ Queensway</strong>
</p>
<p>Our philosophy of student leadership development is guided by the following
beliefs:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student can be developed as
a leader</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student should be developed
as a leader</p>
<p>The Queensway Student Leadership curriculum is premised on the Pillars
of Servant Leadership by Snipe and Frick, namely, being a Person of Character,
Skilled Communicator, Compassionate Collaborator, Having Foresight and
Putting People First. Students develop these attributes through various
platforms such as leadership workshops, outdoor camps, and formal and informal
mentoring sessions.</p>
<p>The school provides an extensive and structured system for providing opportunities
for both broad-based and role-based student leadership development for
our students, adopting a tiered approach to equip all Queenswayans with
essential leadership competencies.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Tier 1 Leadership (Self-Leadership)</strong> aims
to equip all Queenswayans with good self-knowledge, sound values and personal
effectiveness. Students learn the fundamental skills about leadership and
how to use them to effectively manage themselves and their peers.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Tier 2A / 2B Leadership (Team Leadership)</strong> provides
student leaders with knowledge and skills to support initiatives for active
student leadership to make a positive difference at home, in class, within
the school and in their community. Students are provided with platforms
from which they learn to influence and lead their peers with competence
and care.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Tier 2C Leadership</strong>  <strong>(Thought Leadership)</strong> seeks
to develop critical and inventive thinking in student leaders to inspire,
influence and direct their teams that they are leading. Student leaders
aspire to live out the belief that leadership is not about exercising positions
of power but positions of positive influence.</p>
<p>Queenswayans enjoy a wide range of opportunities to lead and serve their
community. These include formal leadership roles such as:</p>
<p><strong>Class Committee</strong> – Fostering a positive classroom environment
and strengthening class spirit.</p>
<p><strong>CCA Leaders</strong> – Promoting the joy of learning and building
a sense of community beyond the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Student Council</strong> – Representing and serving the student
body through various initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>The QSS Student Council is organized into five committees, each with a distinct mission:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>School Spirit, Culture, and Identity</strong> – Strengthening school
identity and nurturing a vibrant school culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peer Support</strong> – Creating an inclusive environment where
every student feels valued and respected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Advocacy</strong> – Representing the student voice and
championing their interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training</strong> – Developing and equipping the Student Council
with the skills needed to serve the school effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communications</strong> – Managing communication between the Student
Council and the school community.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>My student leadership journey at Queensway has truly unlocked many aspects of my potential. I never was the most recognized leader, but along my journey, with each mistake I made and every opportunity I took to grow, it shaped me into the leader I am today! I am grateful for the opportunity given by the Prefectorial Board and the school to represent and be a voice for my fellow peers!</em>

<p><em>Tharuli Nethasa, Head Prefect</em>

<p><em>“Throughout my leadership experience as the leader of Boys Brigade, I have realized that being a leader is not just about having more control over the role I was given, but more about knowing the people whom I am working with and understanding them. I truly appreciated having the chance to lead my CCA, where I discovered many significant life skills.”</em>
