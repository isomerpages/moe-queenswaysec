### Student Leadership

![Student Leadership 1](/images/SLI.png)

Our philosophy of student leadership development is guided by the following beliefs:

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student has the potential to be developed as a leader

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leadership entails confidence and taking the initiatives to make a positive difference

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student leadership development needs to be intentional

The Queensway Student Leadership curriculum is premised on the Pillars of Servant Leadership by Snipe and Frick, namely, being a Person of Character, Skilled Communicator, Compassionate Collaborator, Having Foresight and Putting People First. Students develop these attributes through various platforms such as leadership workshops, outdoor camps, and formal and informal mentoring sessions.

The school provides an extensive and structured system in providing opportunities for both broad-based and role-based student leadership development for our students, adopting a tiered approach to equip all Queenswayans with essential leadership competencies.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Tier 1 Leadership (Self-Leadership)** aims to equip all Queenswayans with good self-knowledge, sound values and personal effectiveness. Students learn the fundamental skills about leadership and how to use them to effectively manage themselves and their peers.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Tier 2 and 3 Leadership (Team Leadership)** provides student leaders with knowledge and skills to support initiatives for active student leadership to make a positive difference at home, in class, within the school and in their community. Students are provided with platforms from which they learn to influence and lead their peers with competence and care.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Tier 4 Leadership** **(Thought Leadership)** seeks to develop critical and inventive thinking in student leaders to inspire, influence and direct their teams that they are leading. Student leaders aspire to live out the belief that that leadership is not about positions of power but positions of positive influence.

Queenswayans have diverse opportunities to lead and serve their community around them, including serving in formal leadership appointments such as:

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Class Committee** – Promote a conducive environment and foster class spirit

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Prefectorial Board** – Support and strengthen school identity and culture

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Peer Support Board** – Develop a community of care in school

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **House Leaders** – Promote social interaction between Queenswayans and foster a strong school spirit

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **CCA Leaders** – Promote joy of learning and spirit of community beyond the classroom

_My student leadership journey at Queensway has truly unlocked many aspects of my potential. I never was the most recognized leader, but along my journey, with each mistake I made and every opportunity I took to grow, it shaped me into the leader I am today! I am grateful for the opportunity given by the Prefectorial Board and the school to represent and be a voice for my fellow peers!_

_Tharuli Nethasa, Head Prefect_

_“Throughout my leadership experience as the leader of Boys Brigade, I have realized that being a leader is not just about having more control over the role I was given, but more about knowing the people whom I am working with and understanding them. I truly appreciated having the chance to lead my CCA, where I discovered many significant life skills.”_

_Allan Tan, Boy’s Brigade Company Sargent Major_
