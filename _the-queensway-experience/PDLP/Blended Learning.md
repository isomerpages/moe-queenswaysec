### Blended Learning at Queensway
At Queensway, students gain knowledge of the curriculum through a blended learning model, which combines in-school instruction with online Home-Based Learning (HBL).

The HBL Day is once every fortnight and operates on a rotating basis. 

HBL also incorporates an hour of Student-Initiated Learning, where our students explore projects and skills that they are interested in. This can include anything from cooking to sports to art to coding. Students share their progress and reflections with each other, helping to deepen their passions and interests and nurturing a sense of curiosity in the world around them.
