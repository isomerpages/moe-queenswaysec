### Mother Tongue Language

#### Department Mission

To nurture Queenswayans to learn, understand and appreciate Mother Tongue languages and be immersed in their own heritage and culture. 

#### Signature Pedagogy

##### Collaborative Learning through use of ICT

Our Queenswayans undergo Project Work as one of their Weighted Assessments every year from Secondary 1 to 3. Through these Project Work, students research on real-life issues, and learn to communicate in their MTL to a designated audience, to achieve a specific purpose. Students will also hone their ICT skills as they produce digital artefacts through the process.

##### Bilingualism Programme

Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. QSS Bilingualism Programme aims to help prepare our children to plug into a globalized world and strengthen links to our Asian heritage. Guided by our teachers, students will hone their writing skills and publish their works in school publication. Students will also be provided platforms to participate in speaking and writing competitions, seminars and learning Journeys to ignite their passion and boost their confidence in the languages.
