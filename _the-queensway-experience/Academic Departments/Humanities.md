### Humanities

#### PHILOSOPHY  

To develop Queenswayans into concerned students and critical thinkers in a globalised world.

  

#### TEACHING APPROACH

The Humanities Department in Queensway Secondary School comprises History, Geography and Social Studies.

<img src="/images/hum1.png" style="width:100%"> Central to Humanities education in Queensway Secondary School is the Humanities Inquiry Approach, which seeks to promote learning through inquiry. The process entails looking at:

*   **_the elements of Inquiry,_**&nbsp; &nbsp;
*   ***the process of Inquiry*** 
*   **_the culture of Inquiry._**
    

  

As participants in the inquiry process, students learn to explore the interaction process between people and their environment, as well as the past and the present.

#### USE OF ICT

At our Humanities Department, we harness the power of digital tools and platforms like the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), Pear Deck, and the Google Classroom to create meaningful and engaging learning experiences in History, Geography, and Social Studies. Through these platforms, students access interactive multimedia resources, participate in virtual discussions, and explore content beyond traditional textbooks.

Using SLS, students can engage in self-paced learning with interactive lessons, quizzes, and multimedia resources, allowing them to review concepts independently or deepen their understanding of key topics. ICT tools, like Pear Deck enhances engagement during lessons by enabling teachers to conduct live polls, quizzes, and interactive questions that encourage students to think critically and participate actively. Students work collaboratively on group projects, analyze sources, and present findings, developing essential teamwork and communication skills in a digital environment. Through these ICT tools, our department aims to enhance engagement, encourage collaboration, and build digital literacy, equipping students with the skills needed for the future.

#### DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION

Our Humanities Department is committed to providing a supportive and inclusive learning environment through differentiated instruction. This approach allows us to tailor both teaching methods and content to meet the diverse needs and abilities of our students.

In the classroom, various levels of scaffolding are introduced to support students at different levels of understanding, ensuring everyone can engage with and master key concepts. Class activities are also customized with differentiated content and activities, allowing students to learn at their own pace and depth. For example, to enhance engagement, we incorporate differentiated content within gamified settings, where students of mixed abilities collaborate and learn through interactive and competitive activities. This approach fosters a more dynamic, inclusive, and enriching classroom experience for all learners.



#### ENRICHMENT PROGRAMMES  

The Humanities Department organizes enriching learning journeys to various organizations, allowing students to expand their knowledge beyond the classroom. Through these visits, students deepen their understanding of Singapore's diverse cultures and explore sites of historical significance. In addition to gaining insights into History and Geography, students engage with current affairs through specially organized talks.

 Students with a strong interest and aptitude in the Humanities are encouraged to participate in national-level competitions such as the NUS Geography Challenge, the MOE History Challenge, the ASEAN Symposium, and the United Nations Mock Conference. Furthermore, students have the opportunity to observe live parliamentary sessions on Sitting Days, gaining firsthand experience of Singapore's legislative process.



#### ASSESSMENT

Towards promoting inquiry learning, formative assessment within the department takes place across all levels. Students at lower Secondary take part in Historical and Geographical Inquiry, while those in Upper Secondary also engage in inquiry tasks for Social Studies.
