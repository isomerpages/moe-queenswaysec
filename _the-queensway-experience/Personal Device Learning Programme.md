### Personal Device Learning Programme
Every Queensway student will be issued with a Personal Learning Device (PLD) under a co-payment system.

The use of the PLD aims to:

* Support the development of digital literacies
* Support self-directed and collaborative learning
* Enhance teaching and learning

At QSS, the PLD of choice is the Lenovo 500e 2nd Gen Chromebook Convertible. The total cost after GST is $519.00 (with 3-year insurance).
