### Promoting a Sustainable Environment - Applied Learning  Programme (ALP) Tier 1 and 2

The Applied Learning Programme is a tiered series of hands-on modules that are carefully curated to expose students to environmental sustainability issues in Singapore; specifically, water and food sustainability. Over the two-year programme, students will take part in interactive modules designed to cultivate a greater sense of environmental responsibility. Working in teams to complete guided experiments, students will be given opportunities to hone their collaboration, critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

  
**1) Sustainability in Water (Tier 1  - Sec 1)** 
<br>In the first tier of the ALP programme, all Secondary 1 students will learn about the various techniques of water treatment. They will also have the opportunity to harness energy from water and construct a sea perch, which they will use for navigation and water testing purposes.

**2) Sustainability in Food (Tier 1 - Sec 2)**<br>
In Secondary 2, apart from learning about the fundamentals of nutrition, students will learn about the latest technological advancements in food production, innovation and waste management, which Singapore can leverage upon to ensure food security.

  
**3) Programming and its application in Sustainability  (Tier 2 - Sec 3)** Selected students acquired the basic programming language used in Arduino microcontrollers, and learnt to programme their Arduino boards using the drag-and-drop mBlock interface. They teamed up to build their Arduino Bots, and collaborated to test the feasibility and practicality of the completed prototypes to tackle various sustainability issues.  
  
**4) Science Fiesta**   
The Science Fiesta is an annual affair that aims to make Science more accessible and engaging for our students, by demystifying the natural phenomena in everyday life. During this year’s Science Fiesta, the Lower Secondary students observed various Science experiments and demonstrations relating to the theme of Sustainability.  
  

#### Student Experiences:

<br>“Learning about Food Sustainability was really interesting! I really enjoyed carrying out different kinds of experiments using different kinds of food. One highlight for me was the experiment where we turned regular milk into lactose-free milk with the help of enzymes. It was interesting for me because my mother is lactose intolerant and I had always wondered why. I realised it was because her body had lost lactase over time and therefore the lactose in dairy products would turn into lactic acid, which causes diarrhea. Using lactase trapped in alginate beads, it is possible for us to remove the lactose from regular milk right in our own school laboratory.”

“I have learned interesting knowledge from the ALP programme. Apart from conducting fun experiments with food, I have also acquired practical skills to obtain accurate results in my experiments. ALP is a fun subject. I enjoyed every ALP session. My favourite session taught me how to use upcycled materials from home to grow edible plants. It allowed me to express my creativity while learning more about Science.”

“I really enjoyed the hands-on activities and working closely with other people on our project to programme our Arduino boards to solve problems facing Sustainability. Through the Tier 2 ALP, I have acquired basic coding in Arduino and turned my ideas into prototypes.”
