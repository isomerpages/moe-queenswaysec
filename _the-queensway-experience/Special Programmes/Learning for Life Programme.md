*   Inculcate sports enjoyment and deep appreciation for lifelong learning by providing students with skills for personal development in competitive and recreational sports, physical and outdoor activities.  
    
*   Nurture sound moral values, deep national identity and global citizenship values to think globally and act locally and ethically.  
    
*   Develop resilience and drive for excellence through learning experiences and active participation in sports, physical and outdoor activities.
