### Community Youth Leadership

At Queensway Secondary School, our Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) helps students grow into confident, caring, and community-minded leaders who make a positive impact on others. 

Grounded in the Servant Leadership framework, the programme encourages our students to lead with kindness, empathy, and purpose. 

Through Values-in-Action (VIA) projects, school initiatives, and community partnerships, our students: 

*   Think critically and creatively to solve real-world problems. 
    

*   Show care and respect by connecting with people from all walks of life. 
    

*   Work well with others and communicate confidently in different settings. 
    

From Secondary 1 to 4, every student takes part in a leadership journey that helps them grow through four stages: 

1 Leading Self – Developing self-awareness and personal responsibility. 

2 Leading Teams – Learning teamwork and shared leadership. 

3 Leading School – Taking on leadership roles in CCAs and school events. 

4 Leading Beyond – Making a difference in the wider community. 
    

Our programme is guided by five Servant Leadership pillars:  

*   Person of Character  
    

*   Putting People First  
    

*   Skilled Communicator  
    

*   Compassionate Collaborator 
    

*   Foresight 
    
At Queensway, we believe that every student is a leader in their own way. Through the LLP, our students grow in confidence, learn to serve others, and lead with heart, both in school and beyond.
