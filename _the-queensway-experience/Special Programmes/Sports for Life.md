### Sports for Life & Outdoor Education (LLP)


This school-wide programme provides varied experiential learning opportunities in sports, physical and outdoor activities for all students.

  

Through the QSS SOE Programme, we aim to:

  

*   Inculcate sports enjoyment and deep appreciation for lifelong learning by providing students with skills for personal development in competitive and recreational sports, physical and outdoor activities.  
    
*   Nurture sound moral values, deep national identity and global citizenship values to think globally and act locally and ethically.  
    
*   Develop resilience and drive for excellence through learning experiences and active participation in sports, physical and outdoor activities.  
    

  

The 2-tiered SOE Programme enables students with higher ability and interest to pursue the activities at a higher level (Tier 2 /Intermediate Level). The range of programmes include:
