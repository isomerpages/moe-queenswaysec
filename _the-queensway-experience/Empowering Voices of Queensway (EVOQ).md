<h3><strong>EVOQ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>E</strong>mpowering <strong>V</strong>oices <strong>o</strong>f <strong>Q</strong>ueensway
(EVOQ) is a platform that promotes student voice. It was started based
on the belief that everyone in Queensway has something to offer by sharing
their views and experiences, tapping on their expertise that best allows
them to communicate their narratives.</p>
<p>Students will also be given opportunities to attend workshops conducted
by professionals in their respective fields so that they can hone their
skills and work towards being <strong>E</strong>thical, <strong>V</strong>ersatile, <strong>O</strong>riginal
and <strong>Q</strong>uality content creators. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section of our school webpage, we showcase studentsâ€™ initiative
and contributions. We celebrate the Queenswayan way of life as well as
the Queenswayans themselves!</p>
