### English Language Talent Development Programme

The English Language Talent Development Programme seeks to inspire students to go beyond the curriculum and gain a love for English Language and Literature.

Students take part in numerous workshops to broaden their knowledge of reading, writing and speaking. These workshops include public speaking, debate, short story writing and poetry writing. Our students have also represented the school in various competitions such as the Commonwealth Essay Competition and the ACJC Orator's Cup, as well as taking part in the annual Creative Arts Programme camp organised by MOE.

I really enjoyed being able to discuss language and literature with other people from Queensway whom I otherwise wouldn’t have met. It was a great choice for me to join and I can’t wait for next year!

EL TDP has been a really fun experience that has been extremely beneficial in developing my linguistic skills in a fun and exciting way. I especially appreciate interacting with the lovely community of teachers and students.
