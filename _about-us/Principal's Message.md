### Principal's Message

<img src="/images/principal.png" style="width:243px;height:340px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Welcome to Queensway Secondary School! I am glad that you chose for your child/ward to join our school. We are very happy to have the opportunity to work with you to groom and develop your child/ward to become the young gentleman/lady that you aspire for him/her to be. <br><br>First, allow me to introduce myself. I am Mr Peter Tan, an educator with over 30 years of experience with stints in schools and MOE Headquarters. I spent the last 18 years as Principal of ACS (Junior) and ACS (Barker Road). I have a passion in working with young people, helping them to uncover and discover their talents so that they can fulfil their goals in life. Over the years of Principalship, I have always found it a joy to work with my colleagues together with the parents/guardians of our students to work towards the best that we can help our students strive towards.<br><br>

As an educator of many years, the secondary school years are often the most pivotal in shaping the direction of life. This makes secondary schooling experience very interesting and exciting and I look forward, together with my colleagues, to journey through the years ahead with your child/ward. You will hear me say repeatedly over the years your child/ward is with us, that his/her PSLE score DOES NOT determine his/her future or destiny. My colleagues and I have witnessed many, many students who have proven this statement a truism. Work with us and I am confident that your child/ward will fulfil the destiny of his/her life. The school's motto is "Success through Diligence", together we will achieve this. <br><br>Warmest regards
