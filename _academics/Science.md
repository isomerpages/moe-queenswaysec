### Science

#### Department Mission

For all Queenswayans toÂ enjoy learning Science, regardless of age or course.

#### Signature Pedagogy

<img src="/images/sci1.png" style="width:303px;height:340px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Science is built on inquisitiveness and asking powerful questions. The use of inquiry based learning aids students in this endeavor as the real-life problems are often open-ended, without a fixed or defined answer. Through this pedagogy, students are taught to examine evidence critically and to draw conclusions from the data which is presented to them through experimentation and observation.

  

The teaching of Science and its concepts is anchored on the following framework.

In the Science classroom, teachers facilitate student learning by infusing values, ethics and scientific attitudes into the core ideas. This learning is augmented with learning about applications of science in practical settings, providing students with a holistic experience of how Science can be used to benefit humans and society.

#### Special Programmes

##### Science Talent Group

The Science Talent Group aims to provide budding Science talents with the opportunity to extend their scientific knowledge and interests beyond the scope of their textbooks. Lower Secondary students will be engaged in experiments using everyday materials to allow them to better see applications of Science in an everyday setting. Upper Secondary students with a strong interest and aptitude in science will be invited to be a part of the Science Talent Group, where they will be trained to represent QSS in national level Olympiads and Science competitions.

Students will also get the opportunity to develop their Science communication skills by presenting their ideas and projects at platforms like our annual Science Fiesta and other related competitions.
