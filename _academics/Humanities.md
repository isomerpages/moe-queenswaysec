### Humanities

#### PHILOSOPHY  

To develop Queenswayans into concerned students and critical thinkers in a globalised world.

  

#### TEACHING APPROACH

The Humanities Department in Queensway Secondary School comprises the Humanities Subjects (History, Geography, Social Studies) and the Commerce Subjects (POA).

*   **_the elements of Inquiry,_**   
*   **_the process and inquiry and_**
    
*   **_the culture inquiry._**
    

  

As participants in the inquiry process, students learn to explore the interaction process between people and their environment, as well as the past and the present.

#### USE OF ICT

Towards supporting the inquiry approach, ICT is used as a means of promoting collaboration among students, scaffolding concepts, formative assessment and self-directed learning. Towards this end, use of ICT tools to promote the stated objectives include Kahoot as a gauge of student learning, and the use of SLS and Nearpod to introduce new concepts to students, as well as to allow for independent learning. 

  

#### DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION

Differentiated Instruction within the Humanities Department focuses on differentiation in pedagogy and content. Within the classroom, different levels of scaffolding may be introduced to cater for differing student abilities. Also, content for classwork activities are also differentiated, and students of mixed abilities may also use the differentiated content within a gamification setting, as made possible within the social studies classroom.

#### ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMES  

Students with passion and aptitude in the Humanities get opportunities to take part in national-level competitions. These competitions include the NUS Geography Challenge and the MOE History Challenge.  Students also get to engage in real-life learning through learning journeys, such as visits to Parliament House on Sitting Days in Parliament.

  

The Humanities Week is carried out each year to showcase student learning and promote national and global awareness. Through the showcase of student projects from the Humanities and Commerce subjects, students get to learn more about Singapore and the world we live in.
