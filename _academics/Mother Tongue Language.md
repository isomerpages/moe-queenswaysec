### Mother Tongue Language

#### Department Mission

To nurture Queenswayans to learn, understand and appreciate Mother Tongue languages and be immersed in the culture. 

#### Signature Pedagogy

##### Collaborative Learning Strategies and Thinking Routines

In QSS, we believe that the acquisition of language is a holistic process that involves cognitive, social and affective skills. This better developed via collaboration. Thinking routines are a series of questions that would lead students to steps of critical thinking. It engages students to explore and delve into deeper conversations. Infusing thinking routines into collaborative learning strategies will improve communication skill and build confidence apart from stimulating learner autonomy. Undergoing this process, our students will be able to grow into responsible, competent and confident language users.


#### Special Programmes:

##### Bilingualism Programme

Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. QSS Bilingualism Programme aims to help prepare our children to plug into a globalized world and strengthen links to our Asian heritage. Guided by our teachers, students will hone their writing skills and publish their works in school publication. Students will also be provided platforms to participate in speaking and writing competitions, seminars and learning Journeys to ignite their passion and boost their confidence in the languages.

  

##### MTL Talent Development Programme

QSS MTL Talent Development Programme strives to enhance our students' language proficiency to prepare them for today's globalised world. To guide the students in their journey of delving into MTL languages, we provide various platforms for our students to horn their language skills and showcase their talents.
